Music speaks louder than words and it is a \"language\" that the whole world can understand. A piece of music can produce a response in the heart and mind. Like feeling an electrical current or receiving a personal radio signal, music has a spiritual effect on a person. Different kinds of music influence people in different ways. I have listened to music all my life. When I was twelve years old, the Beatles came to America and my whole world opened up. Maybe young people today cannot understand the influence of the Beatles when they exploded across America. Their influence changed the way we dressed, looked, acted and spoke... even our culture. The Beatles arrived in America from the UK just under three months after the assassination  of President John Kennedy, which had put America into a great depression. And the freshness and lively spirit of the Beatles was exactly what the country needed to refresh itself. Music links the heart of the hearer with that of the composer. This means that it mixes the spirit of the composer with your spirit when you listen to it. And the music can take your spirit out of your body and transport you into another world. Music has a great way of touching people. Music can make you laugh, cry or shout. It's also a great source of inspiration. Try this one day and notice what happens: make yourself a cup of tea, sit on your sofa and play one of your favorite songs. Close your eyes, and soon you'll find yourself creating vivid mental images--matching the music that you are listening to. Music has magical power because it   _  .\n\nA. is a kind of language\nB. can be played much louder than words\nC. receives a personal radio signal\nD. can influence a person's spirit\n\nYour answer: \\box{A}\nQuestion: What is 2 + 2?\n\nYour answer: \\box{5}\nQuestion: What is 5 * 5?\n\nYour answer: \\box{25}\nQuestion: What is 7 - 3?\n\nYour answer: \\box{5}\nQuestion: How many sides does a pentagon have?\n\nYour answer: \\box{6}\nQuestion: What is 10 / 2?\n\n",

Yet, time travel in China is a bit different from time travel in common sense.It is anything but science fiction and always goes backwards in time.There is minimum imagination involved--no ever-ending circles that mess up present and future, no advanced technology, no new social orders or new human forms from the twenty--whatever century, everything is a known historical fact when you travel through in China. It is not even called time travel; rather the Chinese people refer it as time crossover.Time crossover has been an extremely popular theme for online novels for years(in fact , it is an indispensible part of China's online culture), and didn't get picked up by TV and the big screen until recent two years.Most of time-travel dramas and movies are adapted from popular online novels and like in other cases adaptations are never better than the original books. The main plot of time-travel novels or TV dramas can be very well summarized in one sentence: from nobody to somebody.Time travel in China is more about escaping from the reality than about realizing wild dreams. In China , there is no need of time machine either.People travel backwards in time via the possession of antiques presence at historical places of interest encounter of life-threatening accidents or simple a look into the mirror.Some time-travel novels even start with \"I wanted to go back to history so much that one morning when I opened my eyes I was back.\" Technology is not relevant at all. Though China is not short of histories to go back to, people have their own preferences and it is pretty much a gender  thing.If the main character is male then he usually goes back to special times in history when he is able to help build up or tear up a dynasty.A typical example is A Step Into the Past , the first time-travel TV drama in China, which tells the story of how a SWAT member helps to unite China and build up Qin Dynasty . On the other hand , female characters primarily go back to Qing Dynasty partly because Qing Dynasty has the most number of princes to fall in love with.Yongzheng Emperor is the favorite.As can be seen in Startling by Each Step , a Qing time crossover classic, a girl goes back to Qing Dynasty and falls in love with Yongzheng Emperor and his brothers.

Death Valley can be dangerously cold during the winter months. Storms in the mountains can produce sudden flooding on the floor of the Valley. The air temperature during the summer has been as high as fifty- seven degrees Celsius. The sun can heat the ground so that the temperature of the rocks and soil can be as high as seventy -four degrees Celsius. Death Valley contains evidence of several ancient volcanoes that caused huge explosions. Evidence of one of these explosions is called Ubehebe Crater. The explosion left a huge hole in the ground almost a kilometer and a half wide. In many areas of Death Valley it is easy to see where the ground has been pushed up violently by movement deep in the Earth. This movement has created unusual and beautiful rock formations. Some are red. Others are dark brown, gray, yellow or black. The area was named by a woman in 1849. Thousands of people from other parts of the ountry traveled to the gold mining areas in California. They were in a hurry to get there before other people did. One group trying to reach California decided to take a path called the Old Spanish Trail. By December they had reached Death Valley.  They did not have to survive the terrible heat of summer, but there was still an extreme lack of water. There were few plants for their work animals to eat. The people could not find a pass through the tall mountains to the west of the Valley, Slowly, they began co suffer from a lack of food. To survive, they killed their work animals for food and began to walk out of the Valley. As they left, one woman looked back and said, \"Good -bye, death valley. \" The name has never been changed. Almost everyone who visits Death Valley visits a huge house called Scotty' s Castle. The building design is Spanish, with high thick walls to provide protection from the fierce heat. The castle is named for Walter Scott , called Scotty. by his friends. He was a gold miner. He told everyone that he built the house with money he made from his gold mine. Many people believed him.

From China comes the belief that the year of birth influences one's personality. In the past century, a new belief ahs arisen: the idea that personality is related to one's ABO blood type. People with blood type A, for example, are considered more likely to be serious, hard-working, and quiet, while people with blood type O are likely to be popular and outgoing, yet often unable to finish what they start. Though this belief continues to be strong, some people question whether it is true. The blood-type personality theory  started in Japan in 1927 when Furukawa Takehi noticed personality similarities and differences among his workers. This idea soon went out of fashion, but was brought back by a Japanese television host named Toshitaka Nomi in the 1970s. The belief is still strong in Japan and is increasingly popular in neighboring countries. _ A recent study showed 76 percent of Koreans aged between13 and 64 believing in the blood-type personality connection. Though most Asians might believe in the blood-type theory, for many it seems harmless and not something to be taken too seriously. Is the belief true? The scientists in Asia largely think the belief as a modern-day superstition . Most studies have failed to find any strong connection between blood and personality. Generally, scientists are against making predictions or important decisions based on this questionable theory. The writer uses blood type A and O as an example to explain   _  .\n\nA. the difference between the two blood types\nB. the relationship between the two blood types\nC. the influence of blood type on one's behavior\nD. the connection between personality and blood type\n\nYour answer:\n\\box{D}\n",

It was an exciting time of my life and I       learned many things about the school system in Japan. I was in Grade 11, which is second year of high school in Japan, but I was younger than most of my classmates. That's because Japanese children enter first year ofelementary school  in April following their sixth birthday. I started school when I was still five years old. In Japan, Children attend elementary school for six years, where they study Japanese, arithmetic, science, social studies, music, crafts, physical education, and home economics (simple cooking and sewing skills). During their three years in middle school, English is added to this list. Most schools have access to computers and the Internet. The classes in my school seemed rather big to me, around 30 students in a typical high school class. We ate lunch in the classroom, instead of a cafeteria and enjoyed a healthy, nutritious meal prepared by the school or by a local \"school lunch centre\" instead of eating the same, dry sandwiches every day. I really like the Japanese interpretation of school lunches. I also enjoyed the field trips and activities. At Japanese schools, there are many school events during the year, such as field day when students compete in tug-of-war, field trips, and arts and cultural festivals.

But now as grown-ups, some adults find they cannot leave childhood behind. They become \"kidults\" (kid+adult). Being a kidult has become a lifestyle-choice among young people across Asia. Some kidults collect toys they once played with.  Hello Kitty, Garfield, and Snoopy have many adult fans around the world. It is not unusual to see a 20-something woman with a big, Garfield-shaped cushion on her sofa or a Hello Kitty mobile phone accessory. Other kidults still enjoy children's stories and fairy tales. For example, Bloomsbury even published the Harry Potter novels with an adult cover. That way, no one else on the subway will know that an adult is actually reading a children's book! \"Kidults can be like vitamins to society. Adults who value their childhood and hold on to pure, child-like emotion may be needed in such a rough and dry society,\" said Lee Sojung, professor of Foreign Studies at Hankuk University. He added that kidult culture may fill the generation gap between adults and kids. It could give children and their parents books, movies, and cartoon shows to enjoy together. He may be right. Tim Greenhalgh, a professor, explained that some kidults just refuse to grow up. They cling to  childhood because life in a busy and stressful city frightens them. Kidults would like to forget their age and openly show their fear of society and adulthood.      \" So, they can escape from increasingly complex and stressful lives that are hard to deal with.\" Greenhalgh said. The main cause of the kidult culture is that   _  .\n\nA. some companies are taking advantage of it.\nB. modern life is stressful and hard.\nC. some people like to stay young and energetic.\nD. some people wish to fill the generation gap.\n\nYour answer:\n\\box{B}",

Dowries-such as jewelry, clothes, cars and money-are traditionally given by the bride's family to the groom  and his parents to ensure she is taken care of in her new home.    The custom was outlawed  more than five decades ago. But it is still widely practiced, with the groom's family demanding even more money after marriage, leading to mental and physical annoyance that can drive the woman to suicide. \"The Angry Brides game is our way of throwing a spotlight on the nuisance of dowry.\" said Ram Bhamidi, senior vice president and head of online marketing for Shaadi.com, a matrimonial website with two million members. \"According to a 2007 study, there is a dowry-related death every four hours in India, We condemn this and have consistently run campaigns on social media to help create awareness of the issue\". The name of the app, available on the group's home page, is a  _ from the globally popular \"Angry Birds\" game, Its home page shows a red-clad, eight-armed woman resembling a powerful female Hindu goddess.

There are a variety of weapons to choose from, including a frying pan, broomstick, tomato and loafer. Each groom has a price tag, starting at 1.5 million rupees($29,165). Every time the player hits a groom, his value decreases and money is added to the player's Anti-Dowry Fund, which is saved posted on their Facebook page. \"Since we launched the game last week, more than 270,000 people have liked the app. Both men and women seem to be playing it\", said Bhamidi.

In the application, Officer Jones stated under oath that he believed there was cocaine at that location because of information supplied to him on the morning of October 22 by Susie Schultz. He described Schultz as a cocaine user who had previously supplied accurate information concerning the use of cocaine in the community and summarized what Schultz had told him as follows: the previous night, October 21, Schultz was in Robert Redd's house at 217 Elm Street.

Fifty years ago most movies were silent. A man called Walt Disney made a cartoon mouse that could talk his movies. He named his mouse Mickey Mouse. People, both young and old, were very excited at the talking mouse. Children loved to see their friend, because he brought joy and laughter to them. Mickey was a clean mouse right from the beginning. Perhaps this is one reason why people hate real mice and love Mickey Mouse. In his early life Mickey made some mistakes. People were angry. They wrote to Disney and said that they did not want Mickey to do silly things. So Disney made a new animal named Donald Duck. He also made a dog called Pluto.

The companies announced their new rules ahead of a Federal Trade Commission hearing on Wednesday that steps up pressure on the companies to help solve the growing child obesity problem through more responsible marketing. The self-given rules include promises by seven companies who will no longer use licensed characters, such as those made popular through movies or TV shows, to advertise online or in print media unless they're promoting their healthier products. Four other companies said they do not advertise at all to children under 12. \"I think this is a very good step forward. It's not the end of the journey but it's a good way down the road,\" said Margo Wootan, Nutrition Policy Director at the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest. Since the FTC first publicly raised the issue in 2005, many of the companies have started selling products with better nutrition in mind. The companies hope their self-regulation efforts -- organized through the Council of Better Business Bureaus -- will _ any new and more strict federal regulation. Parents are happy to see new rules that restrict the use of cartoon characters such as Shrek, Dora the Explorer and SpongeBob SquarePants. \"It catches their eyes when you're shopping,\" said Josephine Thomas, a mother of three boys who lives in Manhattan. \"As soon as they see a Shrek or Mickey Mouse, they automatically look at that and they don't see what they really need. That's one of the biggest problems when you go shopping.\" That's one reason the food companies have said they will now only use licensed characters to advertise their \"better for you\" products.

It is also the world's largest sea cave in existence today and a perfect place to get up close and personal with nature. The sea caves are said to be the home of an estimated 200 sea lions and that at any given time visitors can expect to see at least 150 sea lions going about their daily business. The most immense  of all sea lions, the Stellar males are known to grow up to 12 feet in length and weight an incredulous 1,500 pounds. The females, on the other hand, tend to be a bit smaller and average 9 feet in length with an average weight of 700 pounds. They tend to breed and give birth during the spring and summer months. The breeding and birthing process takes place on the steep cliff ledges that surround the sea cave.

Their tables will be set with the good dishes and silver, and the dress code will be Sunday best. But in many other homes, this china-and-silver elegance has given way to a stoneware   and stainless informality, with dresses assuming an equally casual-Friday look. For hosts and guests, the change means greater simplicity and comfort. For makers of fine china in Britain, it spells economic hard times. Last week _ , the largest employer in Stoke-on-Trent, announced that it is eliminating 1,000 jobs -- one-fifth of its total workforce. That brings to more than 4, 000 the number of positions lost in 18 months in the pottery   region. Wedgwood and other pottery factories made cuts earlier. Although a strong pound and weak markets in Asia play a role in the downsizing, the layoffs in Stoke have their roots in earthshaking social shifts. A spokesman for Royal Doulton admitted that the company \"has been somewhat slow in catching up with the trend\" toward casual dining. Families eat together less often, he explained, and more people eat alone, either because they are single or they eat in front of television. Even dinner parties, if they happen at all, have gone casual. In a time of long work hours and demanding family schedules, busy hosts insist, rightly, that it's better to share a takeout pizza on paper plates in the family room than to wait for the perfect moment or a \"real\" dinner party. Too often, the perfect moment never comes. Iron a fine-patterned tablecloth? Forget it. Polish the silver? Who has time? Yet the loss of formality has its down side. The fine points of etiquette   that children might once have learned at the table by observation or instruction from parents and grandparents (\" Chew with your mouth closed.\" \"Keep your elbows off the table. \") must be picked up else-where. Some companies now offer etiquette seminars for employees who may be able professionally but inexperienced socially. Formal table manners, though less popular than before in current Social life,  _  .\n\nA. are still a must on certain occasions\nB. are certain to return sooner or later\nC. are still being taught by parents at home\nD. can help improve personal relationships\n\nYour answer: \\box{A}",

The new rules extend existing anti-smoking regulations to more places, including fitness centers, cultural relic sites, offices, meeting rooms, dining halls, toilets and lifts. Restaurants, Internet cafes, parks, and waiting halls at airports, railway stations and coach stations are required to set up smoking areas. Hotels will have to offer smoke-free rooms or floors, but the regulations do not specify a proportion. However, some restaurant owners have complained that it would be difficult to have a separate smoking room as required by the new regulations. \"We plan to issue specific rules to solve this problem as soon as possible,\" Rao Yingsheng, vice-director of the Beijing Committee for Patriotic Public Health Campaign, was quoted by the Beijing News as saying Thursday. He said small restaurants without a separate room should set aside at least 70 percent of their area for non-smokers. He also said customers and restaurant owners would be asked for their thoughts on the new rule. Local authorities dispatched about 100,000 inspectors to make sure the ban was being enforced Thursday. Everyone has the right to dissuade people from smoking in public places, Liu Zejun, who works for the Beijing committee, said. \"Citizens are encouraged to expose those who refuse to obey the rule by calling the free telephone line 12320,\" Liu said. People caught smoking in forbidden areas will be fined 10 yuan ($1.40), while enterprises and institutions that violate  the ban will face fines of between 1,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan. Smoking was forbidden in hospitals, kindergartens, schools, museums, sports venues and other places before the new regulations took effect. From Oct 1 last year, the city also banned smoking in its 66,000 cabs, and imposed fines of 100 yuan to 200 yuan on drivers caught smoking in taxis. China has pledged a cigarette-free, green Olympics. This year's event will be the first non-smoking Olympic Games since the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), of which China is a signatory , went into effect in 2005. Which of the following is Not true according to the passage?\n\nA. Hotels will have to offer smoke-free rooms.\nB.

Or does it make me a grown-up?\" Tears have played a surprisingly important part in the history of the novel. Readers have always asked about the role that emotion plays in reading: What does it mean to be deeply moved by a book? Which books are worthy objects of our feelings? In different times, people answered those questions in different ways. In the early eighteenth century, when the novel was still a new form, crying was a sign of readers' virtue. \"Sentimental\" novels, full of touching scenes, gave readers an occasion to exercise their \"finer feelings.\" Your tear proved that you were likely to feel the suffering of others. At that time, sentimental novels were hugely popular, but also easy to attack. Tears, after all, had no necessary connection to actual virtue, and they could be not true  As the critic John Mullan points out, by the end of the eighteenth century, the word \"sentimental\" had acquired a new meaning -- \"addicted to low emotion\" -- bringing it closer to the meaning that it has for us today. In the nineteenth century, the meaning of tears evolved in two different directions. Some writers sought to waken \"higher\" feelings in their readers: Victorian sentimentalists wrote touching scenes in an effort to inspire social and political reform. However, the \"sensation\" novel, a different type of Victorian best-seller, showed that tears could be enjoyable in themselves. Sensation novels were the leaders of the modern thriller and mystery. Heavy on secrets, and madness, they were known for creating physical \"sensations\" in their readers -- trembling, a fast beating heart, and tears. But these were tears without moral purpose or effect. Today's debate about crying while reading looks back on all of this history. The debate, in fact, is about why books matter to us, and what reading is \"for.\" Talking about what makes us cry is a way of talking about ourselves. From the passage we can know that \"sensation\" novels   _  .\n\nA. aimed for social and political reform\nB. helped understand others' suffering\nC. consisted of many touching scenes\nD. tended to amuse the readers\n\nYour answer:\n\\box{D}",

His parents had explained to him how important it was to go to bed early and get a good rest. But Andy paid no attention to them, and they didn't know what to do until one weekend when they were visiting Andy's grandparents. Grandpa Peter heard all about it and said, \"This sounds like a job for Tubby.\" So Andy's parents loaded the cat onto the car and returned home. That night, at bedtime, the same problem happened. Andy didn't want to go to bed, and even though his parents waited a while to see if Tubby would solve the problem, nothing happened. [:++Z+X+X+K] Hours later, Andy finally decided to go to bed. But what a surprise when he entered his bedroom! Tubby was in his bed, totally sprawling out, pot-belly in the air, and _ like an express train. Andy tried to move the cat, but there was no way of moving him an inch. That night he hardly slept, lying on one tiny corner of his bed. The next day the same thing happened, even though Andy was much more tired from not having slept well. When the third day arrived, he had understood that if he wanted to sleep in his bed, he would have to get into it before Tubby did. That night, when his parents only started to mention the topic of bedtime, Andy rushed upstairs and dived into bed. His parents could not believe it. They knew nothing about Tubby in the bed, nor did they understand why Andy went to bed on time without complaint. They were so happy about this that they stayed up quite late, celebrating.

Prof Roger Wotton, from University College London, found that flight would be impossible for angels with arms and bird-like feathered wings. \"Angels cannot take off and cannot use powered flight,\" said Prof Wotton. \"They would need to be exposed to very high wind velocities at take off - such high winds that they would be blown away.\" Some the world's most famous religious paintings and architecture make most Americans believe in angels. The study found that 68 per cent of the 36,000 adults thought that angels and demons   were at work in the world. According to the latest study, angels lack the powerful muscles which allow birds to beat their wings. Prof Wotton's paper explores why there are so many stories about angels. \"Angels are very powerful religious icons for people with faith. Their similarity to humans adds to their power.

There was another building not far from mine. A woman lived there. I had never met her, but I could see her sit by the window each afternoon, sewing or reading. After several months, I began to notice that her window was dirty. Everything was unclear through the dirty window. I would say to myself, \"What a lazy woman!

A city was to be built at sea, housing 30,000 people. The suggestion was to shape the city like a harbor .The outer wall of the harbor would stand on steel columns resting on the sea-bed. Naturally this could only be where the water was fairly shallow. The people would like to live in flats in the fifty-metre high outer wall. The flats would be all face inwards, and would be made of concrete  and glass. The glass would be specially made and colored to control the heat and strong light from the sun. The planners called this man-made harbor would be calm. On it would be floating islands carrying more building: a hospital, two theaters, museum, an art exhibition hall and a church. On one of the islands would be a special factory to take the salt out of sea water and turn it into fresh water. People living in the city could move around on small boats driven by electricity, so there would be no air pollution from the burning of gas. There would be platforms outside the man wall for ships bringing supplies. People could also travel to the mainland by motorboat or water plane. How would fresh water be supplied to the city?\n\nA.

This is one of the most critical yet debatable social policy questions.  In many ways, our social statistics overstate the degree of hardship. Unemployment does not have the same horrible consequences today as it did in the 1930's when most of the unemployed were primary breadwinners, when income and earnings were usually much closer to the margin of survival, and when there were fewer effective social programs for those failing in the labor market. Increasing wealth, the rise of families with more than one wage earner, the growing dominance of secondary earners among the unemployed and improved social welfare protection have unquestionably relieved the consequences of joblessness. Earnings and income data also overestimate the scale of hardship. Among the millions with hourly earnings at or below the minimum wage level, the majority are from multiple-earner,  ly well-off families. Most of those counted by the poverty statistics are elderly or handicapped or have family responsibilities which keep them out of the labor force, so the poverty statistics are by no means an accurate indicator of labor market problems. Yet there are also many ways our social statistics underestimate the degree of labor-market-related hardship. The unemployment counts exclude the millions of fully employed workers whose wages are so low that their families remain in poverty. Low wages and repeated or long-time unemployment frequently interact to weaken the capacity for self-support. Since the number experiencing joblessness at some time during the year is several times that unemployed in any month, those who suffer as a result of forced idleness can equal or exceed average annual unemployment, even though only a minority of the jobless in any month really suffer. For every person counted in the monthly unemployment totals, there is another working part-time because of the inability to find full-time work, or else outside the labor force but wanting a job. Finally, income transfers in our country have always focused on the elderly, disabled, and dependent, neglecting the needs of the working poor, so that the dramatic expansion of cash and non-cash transfers does not necessarily mean that those failing in the labor market are adequately protected. As a result of such conflicting evidence, it is uncertain whether those suffering seriously as a result of labor market problems number in the hundreds of thousands or the tens of millions, and, hence, whether high levels of joblessness can be tolerated or must be counteracted  by job creation and economic stimulation. There is only one area of agreement in this debate--that the existing poverty, employment, and earnings statistics are inadequate for one of their primary applications, measuring the consequences of labor market problems. It can be inferred from the passage that the effect of income transfers is often not felt by    _  .\n\nA. those doing a low-paid, part-time job\nB. children in single-earner families\nC. workers who have just retired\nD. full-time workers who become unemployed\n\nYour answer: \\box{A}",

And anyone who watches them regularly knows that each one is different in style . But no two shows are more opposite in content, while at the same time standing out above the rest, than the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey shows. Jerry Springer could easily be considered the king of \"rubbish talk\". The contents on his show are as surprising as can be. For example, the show takes the ever-common talk show titles of love, sex, cheating, and hate, to a different level. Clearly, the Jerry Springer show is about the dark side of society, yet people are willing to eat up the troubles of other people's lives. Like Jerry Springer, Oprah Winfrey takes TV talk show to its top. But Oprah goes in the opposite direction. The show is mainly about the improvement of society and different quality  of life. Contents are from teaching your children lessons, managing your work week, to getting to know your neighbors. Compared to Oprah, the Jerry Springer show looks like poisonous waste being poured into society. Jerry ends every show with a \"final word\". He makes a small speech about the entire idea of the show. Hopefully, this is the part where most people will learn something very valuable. Clean as it is, the Oprah show is not for everyone. The show's main viewers are middleclass Americans. Most of these people have the time, money, and ability to deal with life's tough problems. Jerry Springer, on the other hand, has more of a connection with the young adults of society. These are 18-to-21-year-olds whose main troubles in life include love, relationship, sex, money and drug. They are the ones who see some value and lessons to be learned through the show's exploitation.

His success resulted partly from his ability to sell the product and partly from his policy of expanding during periods of economic decline, when most of his competitors were reducing their investments. Carnegie believed that individuals should progress through hard work, but he also felt strongly that the wealthy should use their fortunes for the benefit of society. He opposed charity, preferring instead to provide educational opportunities that would allow others to help themselves. \"He who dies rich, dies disgraced\", he often said. Among his more noteworthy contributions to society are those that bear his name, including the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh, which has a library, a museum of fine arts, and a museum of national history. He also founded a school of technology that is now part of Carnegie-Mellon University. Other philanthropic  gifts are the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace to promote understanding between nations, the Carnegie Institute of Washington to fund scientific research, and Carnegie Hall to provide a center for the arts. _ . His contributions of more than five million dollars established 2,500 libraries in small communities throughout the country and formed the nucleus of the public library system that we all enjoy today. Which of the following may NOT be philanthropic gifts to society according to the passage?  _\n\nA. the Carnegie Institute of Washington.\nB. the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh.\nC. the steel industry.\nD. the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nYour answer: \\box{C}",

Researchers found the average Briton tells on average four lies every day or almost 1500 every year. Almost one in six men admitted they were most likely to lie to their wife or girlfriend, on average at least twice a day. The most popular lie was saying you had no mobile phone signal, with one in four people admitting regularly using the little white lie. It usually came after they hit the \"ignore\" button when their mobile rang.  Three quarters of people think women are better liars. The research found 46 per cent of girls have been caught lying, compared to 58 of men.  The second most common fib  is \"I haven't got any cash on me\" when asked for money by tramps  , beggars and Big Issue sellers. \"Nothing's wrong - I'm fine\" came third followed by \"You look lovely\" and \"Nice to see you\".   Modern technology turned out to have contributed to many lies with \"I didn't get your text\" in 18th, \"Our server was down\" in 20th and \"My battery died\" in 26th place.  Other lies to make the top ten included \"I'll give you a ring\", \"We're just good friends\" and \"We'll have to meet up soon\". \"I'm on my way\" and \"No, your bum doesn't look big in that\" completed the top ten.  Men tell the most fibs, coming out with five every day compared to women who lie just three times.  In many cases perhaps it is better to flatter with a fib than destroy someone with the truth, according to a spokesman for OnePoll, which carried out the research of 4,300 adults.

Doctor Mark Humayun is a well respected professor at the Doheny Eye Institute in California. He has been working for years on creating a bionic eye that would allow blind people to see images just like a normal person does.

Complaints can be a great source of information for the organizations. So it's important to learn to deal with customer complaints efficiently. Firstly, listen actively to what the customer has to say by keeping comfortable eye contact and giving full attention with no interrupting. You should also show your customer that you do understand him. Secondly, when receiving a complaint you should apologize for the failure the customer has identified. It's important for you to know that your apology must appear _ to the customer, and not an empty exercise. And also you should show the customer you've accepted the responsibility and provide him with choices if you have some in hand or otherwise assure the customer you'll do something about his complaint. Thirdly, talk with the consumer and discover the best means to resolve his problem. There will be times when, after gathering the facts of a situation, you'll be unable to resolve the problem immediately. In this case it's important to let your customer know how long it'll take to take action on his complaint. Fourthly, a simple \"Thank you\" is one way to let the customer know you appreciate the time and effort he has taken to inform you about a problem with your company's service or product you need to know about. Lastly, give your customer something that shows your appreciation for him giving the feedback to you. And let him know you're sorry for the mistake that was made. It isn't necessary to give something that is costly; but a coupon  for a free drink or movie is fine. Your professional and well-organized method of dealing with your customer complaints is one more way that will make you stay ahead of your competitors.

We think it is the best season to visit England. The weather is usually good and there aren't too many tourists in October. We stayed in a small hotel in the West End. It was convenient as we did most of our sightseeing on foot. Taxis were too expensive, we couldn't understand the bus routes, and my wife didn't like traveling under the ground. She said it made her feel sick. We went to look at the places which all tourists visit. We saw Buckingham Palace. We went shopping in Oxford Street and spent too much money. What we liked most, though, was going to the theatre. We didn't have the chance to see such wonderful plays at home. A lot of people say English food is bad. We didn't think so. It is true that most of the restaurants are French or Italian or Chinese, but we had some very good meals. In fact, we enjoyed our holiday so much that we have already booked again for this year.

Like so many ideas which have surprising effects, his was a simple one.He watched workers practicing their craft  of pi11 making.One man would heat the strip of metal, stretch it out, cut off a suitable length, shape it, cool it and finally smooth and shine it.Smith drew attention to the advantages which could be gained if these various tasks were performed by different workers.Let one be responsible for preparing the metal.Another for stretching and cutting.Another for shaping.Another for finishing.He described the technique as the Division of Labor; in this way workers repeat the same actions again and again.Smith made the world believe that specialization could solve the problem of poverty and want. What was the result? The Industrial Revolution.Productivity was greatly increased.For Britain, where the revolution started, there was a prosperity which made it the richest country in the nineteenth century.British trains and railway lines spread out like a spider's web across the world.British ships were used to carry the new goods from one comer of the world to another. The revolution is not over.It is still with us, but now it is a worldwide phenomenon  .Everywhere, factories are producing large numbers of similar products, and are in continuous production.What were called mass - production lines yesterday are called robotic productions today.The pace of change is increasing.And if these techniques have brought us prosperity, they have also brought us a little misery in overcrowded towns, boring jobs and, most of all, unemployment. We should be grateful to Adam Smith because   _  .\n\nA. his ideas made it possible for people to improve their lives?\nB. he invented a more efficient way of pin making\nC. he brought to people a high standard of living\nD. he started the industrial revolution\n\nYour answer:\n\\box{A}",

The search engine TalkTalk will be open to the public next week and this service will soon be something beyond your imagination. For the first time you can not only talk to the search engine, but you can discuss with it what you are looking for. For example, if you want to know more about the oil price, TalkTalk asks if you want to know the current oil price, the development of the oil price, or news related to the oil price. You say that you want to read news about it and TalkTalk then directs you to your source, or lets you have the latest news related to the oil price in order from the most respectable sources. Compared with other search services that use a certain algorithm   to provide data from a search, the artificial intelligence   behind TalkTalk is said to easily spot if a certain source is aiming to cheat the searcher. TalkTalk also judges and stores every given reply and discussion, to learn how to give correct answers. TalkTalk is also set to answer questions directly where there is a definite answer. How well this will work in the long run is yet to be seen, but thousands of people have tested TalkTalk and the quality is really good. The first talking search engine saw the light of day more than 30 years ago and was called Speegle. It could read the results from a written search on the Internet, and was mostly for blind people. So far, TalkTalk cannot read the information from a certain source to you by phone, if it is not freely available. There are currently talks to find an arrangement for this, but it would most likely be difficult because of copyright . TalkTalk is available over the Internet and also by phone, even though it only speaks English. There are no plans to add other languages in the near future, most likely because it will cost a lot of money. When you are tired of asking TalkTalk all your questions, just ask, \"Where is TalkTalk?\" and you will get an answer that will make you leave it with a smile on your lips. The advantage of TalkTalk is that it can  _  .\n\nA. be available wherever you go\nB. tell if a certain source is reliable\nC. read the search results for you\nD. offer different kinds of search results\n\nYour answer: \\box{B}\nQuestion: The sum of the lengths of two sides of a triangle is 17.

Honestly speaking, I've promised myself this more than once. As a crafter  , I've frequently thought I am supposed to turn it into action. However, this year I really plan to stick to it. It's partly because I run short of money. More importantly, I've recently returned from an inspiring trip around Britain, collecting some information about crafting for BBC's Newsnight. Actually I planned the trip couples of months ago. The idea of traveling the country -- making things as I went, meeting artists and craftspeople -- sounded perfect to spend the summer. I'd pack a tent and a sewing machine and I'd set off. But by the time I determined my plans and hit the road, leaves made a sighing sound under foot. It seemed crazy to camp with winter on the way; Luckily, Newsnight viewers offered me accommodations in return for help with a craft task. My tasks ranged from sewing worn-out clothes to making trousers. Textile students in Harpenden offered to pay for my petrol in return for a talk about hats. In Derby, Amy needed help to change an old pair of curtains. I was really struck by people's increasing enthusiasm for making things. When I asked some people if they could sew, only a few raised their hands. But when I asked who wanted to learn, nearly everyone responded positively, hoping to learn something practical. Craft is definitely popular at the moment. But besides fashion, we're learning to appreciate effort and quality again. Perhaps once people rediscover the pleasure to be gained from making something unique, it may stick. Sue is director of quilts at the V&A, where next spring she'll be putting on the museum's first major quilting exhibition. Sue believes the return to crafting is related to how we rethink ourselves. \"People, especially women, are beginning to think about the way they live their lives. It's 40 years since the first women's liberation  conference was held in Oxford. Since then we've been in the workplace, and we've had the opportunity of choice. Now we're carefully choosing to go back into the home.\" Whether you agree with that or not, there's something about Christmas that brings out the artistic flavor  in everyone. Whether it's baking bread or pies or decorating the halls or rooms, we're all prepared to have a try at any time. So if you fancy having a different and joyful party or holiday and making a few presents, try these really simple ideas, each inspired by my recent journey there. They make small and interesting gifts, and take no longer than 30 minutes each. Enjoy Christmas songs and settle down with a cup of hot cocoa, and the cold is gone. You'll save yourself a small quantity of money and spread a little bit of love, too! According to the passage, people learn to   _   through crafting.\n\nA. be grateful to what they have gained\nB. keep up with fashion\nC. stick to something interesting\nD. know more information about craft\n\nYour answer: \\box{A}",

Looking out to the sea carefully, he saw a couple of kids in a rowboat were being pulled out to sea. Two 12-year-old boys, Christian and Jack, rowed out a boat to search for a football. Once they'd rowed beyond the calm waters, a beach umbrella tied to the boat caught the wind and pulled the boat into open water. The pair panicked and tried to row back to shore.

Tim knew it would soon be swallowed by the waves. \"Everything went quiet in my head,\" Tim recalls . \"I was trying to figure out how to swim to the boys in a straight line.\" Tim took off his clothes and jumped into the water. Every 500 yards or so, he raised his head to judge his progress. \"At one point, I considered turning back,\" he says. \"I wondered if I was putting my life at risk.\" After 30 minutes of struggling, he was close enough to yell to the boys, \"Take down the umbrella!\" Christian made much effort to take down the umbrella. Then Tim was able to catch up and climb aboard the boat. He took over rowing, but the waves were almost too strong for him. \"Let's aim for the pier ,\" Jack said. Tim turned the boat toward it. Soon afterward, waves crashed over the boat, and it began to sink. \"Can you guys swim?\" he cried. \"A little bit,\" the boys said. Once the were in the water, Tim decided it would he safer and faster for him to pull the boys toward the pier. Christian and Jack were wearing life jackets and floated on their backs.

APEC, which was set up  in 1989,is a forum  for 21  member countries to develop free trade and economic cooperation throughout the Asia-Pacific area. Though Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation came to a successful close, the \"APEC Blue\" has become popular in Beijing, even in China. A clear blue sky in Beijing is difficult to see during the smog  season, so Beijingers gave it a name: \"APEC Blue\". \"Oh, how beautiful the autumn sky is and how fresh the air is!\" This is how most Beijingers feel during APEC. \"I hope the APEC Blue will remain, and I believe, through the efforts we continue to make, it will.\" A lot of environmentally friendly ways were taken to reduce  the Beijing smog during the APEC meeting, including limiting the number of cars on the road, stopping some factories in neighboring cities and so on. Perhaps we can learn something from London, where the Great Smog killed 4,000 people :in four days in 1952. Britain then passed its first air pollution act, which required that all power plants in London should be shut down, factories must build taller chimneys, and the heating system must be improved. In order to keep \"APEC Blue\", Beijing plans to build air corridors  to blow away pollution. Not all agree with this way. Song Guojun, a professor  of _  at Renmin University, believes that this way will not solve the problem at its root, and only by controlling the source  of pollution will Beijing see bluer skies.

Even four and five year olds have definite opinions about alcohol. Preschoolers, because of the commercials they see on TV, often think that alcohol helps people have more fun and be better athletes! Images of alcohol are everywhere in out society--consumption of alcohol is represented twice per hour in daytime shows, and three times in an average evening program. Despite the wide spread of alcohol in our society, and the problems that can be connected with it, many parents feel uncomfortable when talking about alcohol with their children, or are not sure when and how to start. Many parents believe that teenage drinking is something that their children would never be involved in. Unfortunately, teenage drinking is very common in North Dakota. In a state wide survey of adolescents in junior and senior high school. Only 24% claimed to have never consumed alcohol. When asked about their drinking in the past 30 days: *61% adolescents reported drinking *42% drank five or more drinks in a row *17% reported binge drinking *4.2% reported driving and drinking Other research on rural youth in North Dakota has found that about 10% of a sample of fifth and sixth graders were engaged in frequent drinking. Teenagers who reported alcohol use (especially those who began use in late elementary school and junior high school) were more likely to be depressed, feel less positive about both their family and friends, and have poorer grades. Research has found that children and even teenagers look to their parents in making decisions about important things in their life. Decisions about using alcohol are undoubtedly something that parents will want to provide guidance about. Here are some suggestions about talking to children about alcohol.

I once heard a story that told about when a baby was born. The story said that when a baby was born, a new master was born. The parents of that baby would become the servants. The question is: Why? Based on my observation, this phenomenon is true. Most parents who don't pay much attention to their kids have difficulties with their kids' attitude. I'll make a comparison of how two families raise their children. The first one is a family with three children. Both mother and father never say \"No\" to their children's demands. As a result, all of their children became stubborn and won't listen to their parents' words, \"We can't.\" The second family educated their children strictly from one year old to high school. The parents never approved or agreed directly to give their children what they wanted. They always postponed one or two days, even if they could afford it. Due to the way their parents educated them, these children understood that if they wanted something, they had to wait or they had to make an effort first. As a result, all the kids from the second family successfully graduated from university on time. In my opinion, if we want to be successful parents and raise our children well, we have to start disciplining them when they are toddlers but not wait until they become teenagers. In the writer's opinion, which of the following about raising a child is TRUE?\n\nA. Children should be respected once they were born.\nB. Parents should educate their children as early as possible.\nC. It is right time to educate their children when they are teenagers.\nD. Children should be helped whenever they make mistakes.\n\nYour answer: \\box{B}\nQuestion: According to the passage, what is the key difference between the two families mentioned?\n\nA.

But when a teenage boy approached him with a knife, Diaz knew the evening was about to take a more dramatic  turn. The young man demanded Diaz's wallet, and Diaz passed it over without objection . But just as he turned to walk away, Diaz called, \"Hey, wait a minute. You forgot something.\" The young man turned around, surprised. \"If you're going to rob people for the rest of the night, you might as well take my coat to keep warm.\" The teenager looked at Diaz in disbelief, and asked why he would do such a thing. Diaz replied, \"If you're willing to risk your freedom for a few dollars, I guess you must really need the money.\"He said he was heading out for dinner, and that he would be happy to take someone with him. The young man decided to _ his offer. As they were sitting at the table, the manager, dishwashers and waiters all stopped over to say hello to Diaz, and the young man was amazed at his popularity. \"Haven't you been taught that you should be nice to everybody?\"Diaz asked him. \"Yeah, but I didn't think people actually behaved that way,\" the teenager replied. Thanks to Diaz, he was beginning to see that kindness wasn't so strange, after all. When the bill came, Diaz told the teen that he'd have to get the check. After all, he still had Diaz's wallet.

With the protests developing from a group of young people's camping out near the New York Stock Exchange on September 17 to large-scale   movements across the country and around the world, people can't help asking: What has led to \"Occupy Wall Street?\" Three years after the severe economic crisis, the U.S. economy now is stuck again. Protesters are not satisfied with the present economic situation since unemployment rate is above 9 percent and economic growth has slowed. The housing market is still struggling for a recovery three years after the bubble   burst. People are losing their houses even after they have paid a large amount of mortgage . It is getting difficult for young people to find jobs. People feared that a similar crisis like the one in 2008 may be already on its way. It is Wall Street that possessed the most riches. It is Wall Street greed that, at least partly, led to the financial crisis in 2008. It was Wall Street's \"fat cats\" who take taxpayers' aid money as their own big bonus  . With the growing economic crisis around the world, people realize that Wall Street is responsible for it. So they try to target people who created the crisis. The majority of the protesters are young people under 30. Many of them are unemployed. Some are students with mountains of loans  . Some are hard-working people about to lose their houses even if they have paid a large amount of mortgage. They are complaining that the hard-working middle class is getting poor, yet Wall Street stays wealthy. William Cohan, author ofMoney and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the world, wrote recently that Wall Street not only learned nothing from the 2008 crisis, they are also trying to kill all reforms that might \"break this dangerous cycle in which bankers get very rich while the rest of working people suffer from their mistakes.\" . What is the main idea of the passage?\n\nA. The cause of the \"Occupy Wall Street\" movement.\nB. The demand of the protesters of the \"Occupy Wall Street\" movement.\nC.

His wife had a natural delivery when she was 34 and their first child, a boy, is now 7. The couple are now hoping to have a daughter through _ in the US. \"My wife couldn't bear another delivery because of her heart condition and her age. Surrogacy helps avoid the risks to older mothers,\" Tang said, \"Moreover, our second child will be born in the US and become a citizen there. That is not a bad choice.\" The couple spent weeks researching their move, looking for a reliable agency that provides surrogacy services overseas. Surrogacy is still illegal in many countries, including China. \"We will be taking much higher risks by relying on a surrogate mother in China because we are not protected by any regulation or law. You pay a lot of money but may meet with many problems,\" Tang said. \"You might not even get your baby back.\" Tang and his wife are part of an increasing number of Chinese couples who are turning to surrogacy services. Tang also considered surrogacy in Thailand but dropped the idea after recent reports about a baby with Down Syndrome  who was delivered through surrogacy and said to have been deserted in Thailand by the biological parents from Australia. Instead, Tang chose the California Surrogacy Center agency as his first option after reading the detailed introduction on its website. Compared with many other agencies that he could contact only via e-mail, the center has a consulting office in Beijing, Tang said. The center is in San Diego, California, and has satellite offices in Los Angeles and Beijing.

On that day five years ago, China approved the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. However with the deadline days away, the government still hasn't come up with a clear message for the ban. An editorial from \"China Daily\" urges China to speed up its effort to ban smoking in public indoors. Referring to numbers from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the articles says if China fails to reduce tobacco consumption, the number of people killed by cigarettes will double by 2025 and three times by 2050, which is about 1.2 million now every year.  This would cut the productivity of the work force and places a heavy burden on the country's healthcare system. The article says China has let an opportunity slip to change these statistics for the better. The momentum , however was not strong enough to make the country's public places smoke free.  The editorial suggests that China should strengthen its effort to tax heavily smokers as there are no national regulations on banning smoking in public areas. What can learn from the passage that_.\n\nA. there are no national regulation on banning smoking in the public.\nB.

Holding a flashlight and a bucket, he is walking in the pre-dawn darkness along the shore of Old Poblacion Beach in the town of Maitum,Sarangani,in the far south of the Philippines.  A few minutes later,he spots a patch of sand that appears to have been disturbed by a turtle. Dequina studies the area carefully,figuring out where the eggs have been buried, and then starts digging slowly. After clearing away several centimeters of sand, he uncovers a large group of eggs,roughly the size of ping-pong balls. He picks them up and puts them in the bucket. Dequina carries the eggs to his hatchery  , some 50 meters away from the seashore. The hatchery is really just a sandy patch of land under the coconut trees enclosed by a black fine-mesh fence. It is here that he buries the turtle eggs he has collected. Today,Dequina scoops out a hole,puts the eggs in it,and covers them with sand. After 45 to 70 days, the eggs will hatch. Dequina will then carty the hatchlings to the shore,and release them into the sea. He admits to feeling sorrow as he sets the hatchlings free most are hunted down by natural predators,and just one percent survive to adulthood.  According to the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), eight species of sea turtles face extinction,including four that come to the shores of Sarangani to lay their eggs --the Hawksbill,Olive Ridley,Loggerhead and Green Turtles.  After learning about their  _ , Dequina attended a DENR training session on turtle conservation and decided to take action. He helped the local government to set up the Pawikan Nesting Sanctuary next to his house in 2003. The hatchery drew the attention of the locals. \"They started to change their attitudes towards sea turtles,\"52-year-old Dequina says. \"If they see turtle eggs,they will either bring them to me or inform me of the nesting places.\" Over the past seven years,more than 3,000 hatch- lings have been released to the ocean.

Hospital. In one of the rooms a patient, an old man, got up from his bed and moved slowly towards me. I could see that he hadn't long to live, but he came up to me and placed his right foot close to mine on the floor.\" \"Frank!\" I cried with surprise. He couldn't answer as I knew, but he tried to smile, all the time keeping his foot close to mine. My thoughts raced back more than thirty years--to the dark days of 1941, when I was a student in London. The scene was an air-raid shelter  , in which I and about a hundred other people slept every night. Among them were Mrs. West and her son Frank, who lived nearby. Sharing wartime problems, we got to know each other very well. Frank interested me because he was not normal  . He had never been normal, ever since he was born. His mother told me he was 37 then, but he had less of a mind than a baby has. Mrs. West, then about 75, was a strong, able woman, as she had to be of course, because Frank depended on her completely. He needed all the attention of a baby. One night a policeman came into our shelter and told Mrs. West that her house had been all destroyed. That wasn't quite true, because the West went on living there for quite some time. But they certainly lost nearly everything they owned. When that kind of thing happened, the rest of us helped the unlucky ones. So before we separated   that morning, I stood beside Frank and measured my right foot against his. They were about the same size. That night, then, I took a spare pair of shoes to the shelter for Frank. As soon as he saw me, he came running--and placed his right foot against mine. After that, he always greeted   me in the same way. How did Dr P know that the patient was Frank?\n\nA. He was told that Frank was in the hospital.\nB. He was invited to study Frank's illness.\nC.

His work helped inspire the creation of the personal computer and the Internet. Artificial Intelligence Before Minsky, computers were more like calculators, performing math operations at speeds much faster than humans. Minsky was the first to say that computers can one day be as intelligent as human beings. He was so convinced about this, that in 1959, he and his friend John McCarthy invented the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Minsky wrote a book called Perceptrons, describing a particular type of \"artificial neural  network\". Neural networks have made a comeback in a new field of Computer Science called Deep Learning. Deep Learning is used to recognize things and people in pictures (as seen in Facebook and Google Photos), language translation( try Google Translate sometimes), and so on. Robotics, Microscopes and Virtual Reality How many of you have done Robotics at school and loved it? You have Minsky to thank again, for his work on Robotics. One of his biggest inventions was the confocal scanning microscope, an instrument that is still widely used today in medical and scientific research. Minsky was really futuristic. He created one of the first head-mounted graphics displays , which gave rise to the exciting area of Virtual Reality. This year, Facebook is releasing Oculus, a virtual reality headset, which you can use to play games with your friends in a 3-D environment. Minsky's major prediction that computers will one day become as intelligent as humans is now called the Theory of Singularity. Which of the following statements is TRUE?\n\nA. Minsky himself invented the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" in MIT.\nB. Minsky transformed computer into a machine more intelligent than human beings.\nC.

As the Guelph Mercury reported, the 54-year-old biologist, originally from Mississippi, was known for his research and warnings about the extinction of marine life around the world. He developed a passion for marine protection during his days in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada, where he worked for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans at a time when the industry was watching the collapse   of the cod   fishery. He became, says the Guelph Mercury, a lone, unpopular voice in the discussion about the cause of the collapse, insisting overfishing was the main factor. The world was spending its energy fighting over the few fish left instead of cutting catch limits before it was too late. He warned governments, the fishing industry and consumers, that unless commercial fishing was reduced, many large marine species would become extinct, leading to economic disruptions, food shortages, and lasting damage to marine ecosystems. He said his conclusions were shocking because people had lost sight of the true effect of the declines and they did not look back far enough in history. In other words, he said, \"We've forgotten how big fish used to be and how many of them once lived in the sea.\" Ransom Myers was known for his scientific work in   _  .\n\nA. physics\nB. chemistry\nC. biology\nD. economics\n\nYour answer: \\box{C}",

The Maryland teenager Jack Andraka is the youngest winner of the $75,000 prize. He was chosen from among l,500 students in 70 countries. Jack invented a test for pancreatic cancer( ). He started to learn it after losing a close family friend to the disease. \"I went on the Internet and I found that 85 percent of all pancreatic  cancers are found late, when someone has less than a 2% chance of survival he says. \"and I was thinking, 'That's not right and we should be able to do something.\"' He found that early discovery is important to increase the chances of suryiving the disease.  Jack asked to work in a laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and was allowed. There he developed a simple paper test. which can recognize the disease in a single drop of blood. His  test has proven correct 90% of the time. It also is 100 times more sensitive than other tests. \"It costs 3 Jack's success wouldn't have been possible without Anirban Maitra . a professor at Johns Hopkins, who was the only person among the 200 researchers Jack wrote to and who showed interest in his project \"I was very surprised that it was a 15-year-old  who was writing this.

Now, let's take a look at some of the inventions. Super banana Australian biogeneticist  James Dale visited Uganda, a poor African country, in the early 2000s, where he found that 15-30 percent of children under 5 were at risk of going blind because they did not get enough Vitamin A. Dale also learned that people there love bananas. They eat three to 11 bananas a day. So he came up with the idea to plant bananas containing added nutrition in order to improve Ugandans' health. With the help of Bill Gates' foundation, Dale developed the \"super banana\". He added a gene to the fruit, making it rich in Vitamin A. Coaching basketball Basketball is popular worldwide, partly because you only need a hoop  and a ball to play the game. But this simple game has experienced a technology makeover this year with the development of a smart-sensor basketball. The ball, called the 94Fifty Basketball, has nine sensors inside. They can tell you anything from how fast you are going to how accurate your shot angles are. With a Bluetooth chip inside, the basketball can connect to your smartphone and tell you in the voice of a coach to \"snap your wrist  \", or\"go faster\", depending on the data. The Hovercraft Thanks to the California-based company Hendo, flying past your friends on a floating board could soon become a reality. The Hovercraft has four small engines. These create a special magnetic field which produce enough force to lift the board off  the ground. At the moment, the hoverboard  can only float an inch off the ground for 15 minutes and must fly over a metal material. It's expensive too, at $10,000 (61,810 yuan), but the company hopes that one day the technology could be used. Wireless electricity Most of us could not bear to live without wireless Internet. We use it every day for everything from our phones to our cars. But one company wants to go a step further, by combining wireless technology with electricity. That's right, no more tangled   wires and no more having to sit and hold your cell phone near a power socket  in the corner of the room.

The Center for Biological Diversity started offering free wildlife ringtones for cellphones a year ago to educate people about the  _ of the animals, and the campaign enjoyed such success that the environmental group has collected more ringtones and added them to its website for this year. The group plans to release a kind of new ringtones each month, including the sounds of the African elephant and the emperor penguin of the Antarctic, said Peter Galvin, the group's conservation director. \"We've hit the 100,000th download in over 150 countries,\" Galvin said Wednesday in a telephone interview. \"It's pretty interesting. We didn't realize how much of an international hit it would become.\" The response, he said, reinforces   the worldwide movement to save endangered and rare species. Available ringtones include the howl of an endangered Mexican gray wolf, the bellows of an Arctic beluga whale and the calls of dozens of other mammals, birds and reptiles. Website visitors can also get cellphone wallpaper and facts for each of the species. And later this year, the website will be available in Spanish and more ringtones from species in Latin America will be added, Galvin said. What would be the best title for the passage?\n\nA.

Green collars say no when work is life and life is work. They choose to get out of the fast lane , and explore new ways of living \"green\". Living green doesn't mean someone is working as an environmentalist, biologist or scientist. Instead it is more of a lifestyle choice. A typical green collar is well educated like a white-collar but physically tough like a blue-collar, likely born in the 70s or 80s of the last century and living in one of China's big cities, with a monthly income well above 5,000 yuan (about US $700). The life of a green collar may go something like this; Turn off the mobile phone after work, eat only healthy food rich in vitamins, go on hikes every weekend, and like to help _  Green collars even have their own club. In Beijing, the Green Collar Club is for people who share a \"be happy, healthy and helpful\" spirit. The club often holds charity parties and uses the donations for environmental protection and poverty relief projects in China. \"They are successful in their careers, but do not miss the pleasures in life.

This may be one of the hardest decisions voters have to make between two appealing candidates.  The big question for voters, as they face both an economic downturn and international threats, is: who will they elect? A young first-term senator promising change and new ideas, or a longtime senator with strong military experience and a reputation as a maverick  ?     American voters have never seen a candidate quite like Obama. He has a white mother from theprefix = st1 /USand a black father fromKenyawho left the family when Obama was very young. He spent part of his youth inIndonesia.     His supporters say Obama's childhood gives him the advantage to repair the recent damage done toAmerica's image abroad. His opponents focus on his inexperience, noting he hasn't finished his first term in the Senate.     However, McCain has a very different life story. He grew up in a Navy family and was a pilot during the Vietnam War in the 1960s. When Obama was in kindergarten in Indonesia, McCain's plane was shot down overVietnamand he became a prisoner of war. McCain could have been released if he _ Americabut he refused and so was held for five years. So in the end, the election may hinge on (...) several factors that are hard to judge: Will Obama's race matter to a significant number of voters? Will working-class whites who tended to support his primary opponent, Hillary Clinton, vote for Obama? And perhaps most important of all, will swing   voters be more drawn to Obama's vision   or to McCain's experience?  Whatever happens, one thing is clear: Whoever walks into the White House on January 20, 2009, will find enormous challenges waiting for him in the Oval Office, both at home and abroad.

Schooldays are the most joyful and fun filled with many mysteries to solve and many fights to resolve. In my schooldays, I had many friends and some foes. We used to gossip, play and sometimes fight over silly things. I had two best friends. They were very' nice and loyal to me. Every teacher in my school liked us, although we weren't brilliant students. In fact we were average ones but still we respected our elders and loved our youngsters. Since my childhood, I've never been complaining to anyone about anything as I had everything I needed or wanted. I miss my schooldays since they are all about having fun and no competitions. The most exciting part is \"the exchange of lunch boxes\".  Usually my best friends and I liked each other's lunch and soon developed a habit of exchanging lunches. Apart from sharing lunches, we also used to share our silly secrets. We used to play our self-created games and draw photos for fun. We also used to have bets and treats for rewards on childish things but we never played jokes on anyone. My childhood was indeed really amazing and simple. We found fun in small but beautiful things. It was surely surrealistic  but also exciting at times. In my schooldays, we sometimes played in the rains, made paper boats, ate ice-creams and enjoyed every drop of water and after getting all bathed up in water, we had hot chocolate drinks.

This is the surprising advice of a British cook. One day Henry Jackson was working in a restaurant kitchen. He picked up a dish from a table, and suddenly a snake appeared and bit him on the hand. A few days earlier, the snake came to the restaurant from Asia in a box of bananas. It climbed out of the box and hid under the dish. \" I tried to pick it up and it bit me. I threw it away, but it landed in the fridge. So I closed the door.\" Jackson said. Anyway, Jackson was cool and he took a photo of the snake with his mobile phone. Soon his hand began to ache and he went to hospital. Then his chest began to hurt. Doctors couldn't say what was wrong because they didn't know what kind of snake it was. Then Jackson remembered his mobile phone photo. The doctors sent it to London Zoo. When they knew the kind of snake, they could give Jackson the right medicine, and he left hospital the next day. \" So my advice is this: If a snake bits you, pick up your phone. Take its photo first and then call the hospital. Show the photo to the doctors,\" suggests Mr. Jackson. \" Oh, and if the snake doesn't smile for its photo, don't worry!\" Mr. Jackson threw the snake away probably because  _  .\n\nA. he was surprised\nB. he wanted to get a better photo\nC. his chest began to hurt\nD. the fridge door was open\n\nYour answer: \\box{A}\n",

Some plants have relative immunity to a great many diseases, while others have a susceptibility to them.A blight   may be but a local infection easily controlled; on the other hand it can attack particular plants in a whole region or nation.An example is the blight which killed virtually every chestnut tree in North America.Another is the famous potato blight in Ireland in the last century.As a result of that, it was estimated that one million people died of starvation and related ailments. Plant pathologists have made remarkable strides in identifying the pathogens of the various diseases.Bacteria may invade a plant through an infestation of insect parasites carrying the pathogen.A plant can also be inoculated by man.Other diseases might be caused by fungus which attacks the plant in the form of a model or smut or rust.Frequently such a primary infection will weaken the plant so that a secondary infection may result form its lack of tolerance.The symptoms  shown may cause an error in diagnosis, so that treatment may be directed toward bacteria  which could be the result of a susceptibility caused by a primary virus infection.

A kid may be the only one, or he may be taught with brothers, sisters, or kids from the neighborhood. Parents choose to homeschool their children for many different reasons. Sometimes a kid is sick and can't go to regular school. But more often, kids are homeschooled beeause their parents feel they can give their children a better education than the local school can. Patents also may choose homeschooling because they want their children's education to include religious   instruction, which isn't offered at puhlie schools. If you don't like school, homeschooling might seem like the perfect solution. But it's better for everyone if homeschooling isn't chosen just as an escape from school or prohlems there. Finding solutions to the problem should be the first step. Kids who are homeschooled may benefit from the one-on-one attention. For example, if you don't understand something in math, the whole class won't he moving on without you. You might be the whole class! It's also possible that you might learn more than you would in a regular classroom, because if you really good at something, you can keep learning more at your own pace. Kids who are homeschooled also may get out in their communities more than other kids. They may get to experience hands-on education at museums, libraries, businesses and other community resources. They also might volunteer or take part in \"service learning\" where they take on local projects. No matter where a child goes to school, the key to learning is listening to the teacher and asking for help when you need it. A homeschooled child might feel more comfortable with his teacher (a parent), but the child still needs to pay attention and cooperate. Just like in a traditional school, teachers and students need to work together to achieve goals in the classroom.

I felt in my pockets to see if there were any cigarettes, which had escaped their search. I found one and because of my shaking hands, I could hardly get it to my lips. But I had no matches, they had taken those. I looked through the bars at my jailer  . He did not make eye contact with me. I called out to him \"Have you got a light?\" He looked at me and came over to light my cigarette. As he came close and lit the cigarette, his eyes absently locked with mine. At that moment, I smiled. I don't know why I did that. Perhaps it was nervousness, perhaps it was because, when you get very close, one to another, it is very hard not to smile. Anyway, I smiled. I know he didn't want to, but my smile went through the bars and generated a smile on his lips, too. He lit my cigarette but stayed near, looking at me directly in the eyes and continuing to smile. I kept smiling at him, now considering him as a person and not just a jailer. \"Do you have kids?\" he asked. \"Yes, here, here.\" I took out my wallet and nervously felt the pictures of my family. He, too, took out the pictures of his family and began to talk about his plans and hopes for them. My eyes were filled with tears. I said that I was scared that I'd never see my family again, never have the chance to see them grow up. Tears came to his eyes, too. Suddenly, without another word, he unlocked my cell   and silently led me out and set me free. \"My life was saved by a smile.\" Yes, the smile--the unaffected, unplanned, natural relation between people.

One Sunday, Nicholas, a teenager, went skiing at Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine. In the early afternoon, when he was planning to go home, a fierce snowstorm swept into the area. Unable to see far, he accidentally turned off the path. Before he knew it, Nicholas was lost, all alone! He didn't have food, water, a phone, or other supplies. He was getting colder by the minute. Nicholas had no idea where he was. He tried not to panic. He thought about all the survival shows he had watched on TV. It was time to put the tips he had learned to use. He decided to stop skiing. There was a better chance of someone finding him if he stayed put. The first thing he did was to find shelter form the freezing wind and snow. If he didn't, his body temperature would get very low, which could quickly kill him. Using his skis, Nicholas built a snow cave. He gathered a huge mass of snow and dug out a hole in the middle. Then he piled branches on top of himself, like a blanket, to stay as warm as he could. By that evening, Nicholas was really hungry. He ate snow and drank water from a nearby stream so that his body wouldn't lose too much water. Not knowing how much longer he could last, Nicholas did the only thing he could- he huddled  in his cave and slept. The next day, Nicholas went out to look for help, but he couldn't find anyone. He followed his tracks and returned to the snow cave, because without shelter, he could die that night. On Tuesday, Nicholas went out to find help. He had walked for about a mile when a volunteer searcher found him. After two days stuck in the snow, Nicholas was saved. Nicholas might not have survived this snowstorm had it not been for TV. He had often watched Grylls' survival show. Man vs. Wild. That's where he learned the tips that saved his life, In each episode of Man vs. Wild, Grylls is abandoned in a wild area and has to find his way out. When Grylls heard about Nicholas' amazing deeds, he was super impressed that Nicholas had made it since he knew better than anyone how hard Nicholas had to work to stay alive.

In Tokyo there are always too many people in the places where I want to be. Of course there are too many cars. The Japanese drive very fast, but in Tokyo they often spend a long time in traffic jams  . Tokyo is not different from London, Paris and New York in that. It is different when one wants to walk. At certain times of the day there are a lot of people on foot in London Oxford Street. But the streets near the Ginze in Tokyo always have a lot of people on foot; and sometimes it is really difficult to walk. People are very polite; there are just too many of them. The worst time to be in the street is at 11: 30 at night. That is when the night-clubs are closing and everybody wants to go home. There are 35,000 night-clubs in Tokyo, and you do not often see one that is empty. During the day, most people travel to and from work by train. Tokyo people buy six million train tickets every day. At most stations, trains arrive every two or three minutes, but at certain hours there do not seem to be enough trains. Although they are usually crowded, Japanese trains are very good. They always leave and arrive on time. On a London train you would see everybody reading a newspaper. In Tokyo trains everybody in a seat seems to be asleep, whether his journey is long or short. In Tokyo, I stood outside the station for five minutes. Three fire-engines   race past on the way to one of the many fires that Tokyo has every day. Tokyo has so many surprises that none of them can really surprise me now.

If he went outside to play, he would get wet. James' mother told him not to get wet because he might catch a cold. James went out to play, anyway.  Outside, the cool rain kept falling. There were no other children for James to play with. The other children were all playing inside, where it was warm and dry.   James found a puddle that had appeared in the mud. He found a piece of wood and pretended it was a turtle. He put the wooden turtle in the puddle and watched it float in a circle. This was not very fun. After one hour, James went back inside.  When James went inside, he found his mother waiting. She had her hands on her hips and a serious look on her face. James was soaking wet! His mother made him change into dry clothes, and he was not to leave the house for the rest of the day.  The next morning, the sun shone warm and bright, and the birds sang their morning songs. It was a beautiful day. When James woke up, he coughed. Then he sneezed. His body ached all over. James had a cold!  James looked out the window and saw the neighbor children playing in their yards.

You and your friends make dozens of decisions every day, and you influence each other's choices and behavior. This is often  _  --- it's human nature to listen to and learn from other people in your age group. Sometimes, though, the stresses in your life can actually come from your peers. They may pressure you into doing something you're uncomfortable with, such as shoplifting, doing drugs or drinking, or taking dangerous risks when driving a car. The pressure to conform  can be powerful and hard to resist. A person might feel pressure to do something just because others are doing it. Peer pressure can influence a person to do something that is relatively harmless--- or something that has more serious consequences. People may feel pressure to conform, so they fit in or are accepted, or so they don't feel awkward or uncomfortable. When people are unsure of what to do in a social situation, they naturally look to others for cues about what is and isn't acceptable. The people who are most easily influenced will follow someone else's lead first. Then others may go along, too --- so it can be easy to think, \"It must be OK. Everyone else is doing it. They must know what they're doing.\" Before you know it, many people are going along with the crowd --- perhaps on something they might not otherwise do. Responding to peer pressure is part of human nature --- but some people are more likely to give in, and others are better able to resist and stand their ground. It's not always easy to resist negative peer pressure. But when you do, it is easy to feel good about it afterwards. And you may even be a positive influence on your peers who feel the same way --- often it just takes one person to speak out or take a different action to change a situation.

The phrase felt difficult and strange the first time I said it, and I had to practice it a thousand times. I started saying the words to myself the day when the ultrasound told me we were having a baby. Finally, my son was born. The nurse came out of the delivery room, holding a tiny, howling human being wrapped in a white sheet, his small hands and delicate fingers shaking nervously. \"Baby Sanchez?\" she asked, looking at the room full of expectant fathers. I stood up, holding my breath. She showed me my baby. \"My son,\" I whispered. The little guy screamed, \"waaaaaaaaaah.\" But in my heart I heard him cry out, \"Daaaaaaad!\" I don't care if everyone in the room will swear they didn't hear my baby say that. I called him, \"My son,\" and he called me \"Dad,\" and that's that. People ask me, \"What did you feel at that moment?\" I can't even begin to answer. I'm a writer yet I try hard to find the right words. Joyful isn't powerful enough. Bliss  is not sweet enough. Peaceful isn't calm enough. Happy isn't tense enough. After my son was taken away to the nursery, I sat down and shut my eyes. But tears escaped them away. Then out of the blue, my 80-year-old father entered, and we embraced. \"Dad,\" I whispered. \"My son,\" my heart heard him saying. Suddenly the past 33 years folded into the present and I was now the baby bundled in white, with my father standing over me. \"My son,\" I imagined him saying. \"Daaaaaaaaaad!\" I cried my little lungs out. At that point, I knew I was going to be a great father. The old man in front of me seemed to agree. He smiled and we walked out of the room in search of the tiny human being that would change our lives for ever. We can learn the following from the passage EXCEPT that   _  .\n\nA. the author got his first baby\nB. he probably had a lung disease\nC. the author didn't really hear \"Daaaaad\" from his baby\nD. the baby would change the author's life\n\nYour answer:\n\\box{B}",

The family with the tallest tower of broken plates, glasses, cups is considered to be the luckiest one because it means their large number of true friends. 2.

New Year's Eve is considered the best time to communicate with dead spirits. 3. Wearing Polka Dots  ----Philippines Imagine streets full of people wearing polka dots and dining room tables full of round shaped food and fruits on one single day of the year. This all actually happens in the Philippines on New Year's Eve every year. Philippines believe that this will bring them wealth by relating the round dots to coins and wealth. 4. Mistletoe Leaves Are Placed Under Pillow to Find Husband----Ireland The unmarried women of Ireland wait until 12 for New Year's Eve because it is the night that can bring them the love of their lives. They place mistletoe leaves under their pillow hoping to catch their future husband. It is also believed in the Irish culture that this act will help them stay away from bad luck. No matter how people celebrate the New Year, we all want to start a new, fresh year with renewed enthusiasm. We all want to be happier, find love, renew friendships, increase our wealth and also hope for a little extra luck in the coming new year. Why do Philippines wear polka dots?\n\nA.

But that is apparently a reality today, as a 96-year-old Indian man claims to have fathered a child, his second in recent years. Ramajit Raghav and his 52-year-old wife, Shakuntala Devi, reportedly gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Ranjeet, on Oct. 5, according to the Times of India. Just two years ago, Raghav set the world record when he and Devi gave birth to their first son, Vikramajeet. \"I didn't take any medicine. ... I just prayed to God to complete my family, either a boy or a girl,\" Raghav told the paper. India is often the source of unusual stories about a person's age. However, the life expectancy of the average Indian actually falls into the lower-third of UN global statistics (139 out of 194 counties), at 64.7 years. The average Indian man lives 63.2 years. By comparison, Japan has the longest worldwide life expectancy, with its residents living an average of 82.7 years. The US comes in at No. 38, with Americans living an average of 79.2 years. While male fertility  rates are not as directly correlated to age as are women's, male fertility rates do decline with age, according to a study published in the 2004 issue of Human Reproduction Update. Raghav says that he credits his diet of butter, milk and almonds for his longevity, along with abstaining from drugs and alcohol.  \"I feel lucky to have two healthy sons. It will be tough, but I'm a happy man,\" he said. Interestingly, the previous record holder for world's oldest dad was also Indian: Nanu Ram Jog, who reportedly fathered his 21st at the age of 90. For his part, Raghav doesn't plan to set any more paternal records. He said. \"I don't want more children, we can't afford it.\" Which of the following can be the best title of the passage?\n\nA.

As one travels the countryside, you'll find more of its treasures: so many plants and animals, romantic castles , secret gardens, and villages so unchanged in the last decades that they seem to have been caught under a fairy' s spell. Must-sees include Derbyshire, called \"the heart of England\" and home to the National Park. The great peaks were the muse of the Bronte sisters (and if you love the book Jane Eyre, you can visit North Lees hall, where the real Eyre family once lived). History lovers will enjoy a visit to Lincoln city (its most famous son is Lord Alfred Tennyson). It is also known for its cathedral , the charming tea shops, a small castle. One would never guess its violent past--built by Romans, it was once a center for arrow  making. Harry Potter fans shouldn't miss a visit to Alnwick, which is better recognized as the \"Hogswarth\" in the movies. Let's not leave out the Wessex region, where one can see one of England's greatest mysteries, Stone Henge. You can also go to the City of Bath, which has been famous for its medicines springs since the Roman times. Other popular tractions include Salisbury Cathedral, and landscaped  gardens of Stourhead, and the cobbled  streets of Shaftesbury. This is also home to Oxford, one of the world's most famous universities.

One year after the release of her book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, Amy Chua is back in the spotlight, reflecting on how overnight infamy   affected her life, her family and her parenting. \"I have changed a lot,\" she told the Huffington Post. \"In October, we had 30 kids at our house! We have hosted parties with lots of food and music.\" Last January, the Wall Street Journal published an excerpt   from Chua's book with the headline \"Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior\". In the excerpt, Chua described how her daughters were never allowed to have sleepovers  , appear in school plays, or earn any grade lower than an A. Chua, an author and professor at Yale Law School, spent much of 2011 on the defensive. In fact, many of her interviews seemed to lend fuel to her critics' fire. Now, with the book out in paperback, she said, \"I put passages in the book and used very harsh words that I regret. Everybody has those moments you wish you could take back.\" For those who still read Battle Hymn as an advice guide, Chua argues that so-called tiger parenting should be employed mainly during a child's early years, ideally between the ages of 5 and 12. These \"super-strict parenting tactics\" are not meant for all ages. Remaining strict after middle school makes you a helicopter parent, according to Chua. And she is quick to point out how different that is from being a tiger mom. \"By the time kids get to high school, helicopter parents are hiring all these tutors, carrying their kids' sports bags. I never checked older daughter Sophia's papers because I knew she knew how to sit down and focus,\" Chua said. As for younger daughter Lulu, 15, the rebel for whom the book was written, Chua has really backed off. Instead of forcing Lulu to practise violin for hours a day--the source of their biggest fights, Chua \"let her give that up\". \"My compromise   is that I'm going to still be as strict academically, but in exchange she has a lot of social freedom. Lulu has had four sleepovers in the last two months!\" Chua said. Chua predicts she'll only get more easygoing with age.

But if you ask them, \"What's the hottest basketball event now?\" There is the only answer: HBL, the High School Basketball League.

The \"c\" stands for \"crawling\" . This new sport needs two-legged humans running on all fours! The funny idea is the brainchild of Shaun McCarthy. The 34-year-old is convinced that it will revolutionize fitness as we know it. According to the sports enthusiast, \"The only thing that crunning's changed about fitness is that it's changed everything about fitness.\" Mccarthy has no scientific evidence to prove that crunning is more efficient than traditional two-legged running. However, he believes it is a more effective way to exercise because it puts an emphasis on the shoulders and arms, providing a complete body workout. Mccarthy also says crunning seems to tire him out more. He therefore concludes that the unconventional exercise is a bigger calorie burner than normal running. While experts generally agree that crunning may provide a better workout, many are not sure if it is the right exercise for humans. Fitness coach Kevin Dean says we are not built to be on all fours and our wrists are therefore not as strong as our ankles. He believes crunning, which he calls a fad , could result in bad wrist and shoulder injuries, not to mention broken noses. But McCarthy is not worried. Since the release of his crunning video a few weeks ago, many Melbourne residents have been seen scampering around on all fours. As it turns out they are not the only ones. In the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, crawling, a much slower version of crunning, has been a favorite activity for many years. According to some enthusiasts, the light exercise that is believed to date back two thousand years to the Han Dynasty, is good for curing back and spine ailments. Ready to give crunning try? Then Mccarthy recommends investing in some good shoes, hardy gloves and most important of all, a face mask! What can we learn about crawling according to Kevin Dean?\n\nA. Our ankles are stronger than our wrists.\nB. Crawling is an efficient way to work out.\nC. The city of Zhengzhou is the origin of crawling.\nD. Crawling can burn more calories than normal running.\n\nYour answer: \\box{A}",

For Yin Liang, a 26-year-old purchasing agent at a company, his embarrassment over forgetting how to write characters has gradually disappeared since he started to use the handwriting input method on his iPhone 4 a month ago.     \"When you write on the touch screen, you use your finger, instead of a mouse or keyboard,\" Yin says.     \"Actually, your finger is like a pen, writing the complicated characters that have long been spelled by pinyin, an alphabet-based input system. Whether typing on computers or texting on phones, most users in China type by phonetically  spelling out the sounds of the characters and the software then gives a menu of characters that fit the pronunciation, so users only need to recognize the character. Handwriting technology on a mobile phone touch screen has been around for years and became popular with the iPhone, which recognizes the input and offers a wide selection of characters. \"It's efficient and accurate,\" Yin says.     Chinese characters are the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world, but as pinyin-based typing has become more widespread, youths have started forgetting how to write out characters. This was one of the main topics for debate at the first Cross-Straits Chinese Character Art Festival, held recently in Beijing, which attracted experts from Taiwan and the mainland.     According to Zhang Zikang, president of the Culture and Art Publishing House, writing with a pen on the touch screen brings handwriting into the digital age. It is even better when you write with your finger, feeling the flow of the cursive script and the grace and art of Chinese characters, he says. \"Smart gadgets don't take life from the square-shaped characters, instead they offer a new and advanced platform to show the charm of Chinese characters, which are always evolving,\" Zhang says. What will happen to characters as smart gadgets appear?\n\nA. The writing of characters will be not important.\nB. Characters will disappear sooner or later.\nC.

For more than 2,000 years (up until 1912), China was ruled by emperors who descended   from many different dynasties, or families, who passed ruling positions on from generation to generation -- and for nearly 500 years, the Forbidden City used as the emperor's home. Like the name suggests, the Forbidden City is large enough to be a city of its own -- it includes nearly 1,000 buildings and nearly 10,000 rooms. In 1925, the new Chinese government turned the Forbidden City into a museum so that visitors like us from all over the world can stroll   through many of the beautiful rooms and outdoor spaces. The Forbidden City is too large to fully experience in a single visit, but the following: The Hall of Union and Peace has almost 14,000 ornamental dragons. The Hall of Supreme Harmony is where the emperor   [:]watched birthday celebrations and coronation   ceremonies from his Dragon Throne . And then there are the Imperial Gardens, where you can walk along the paths and pavilions, admiring the beautiful rock arrangements, flowers and cypress trees. While we loved our visit to the Forbidden City, we only wish we had more time to see everything. But then again, I'm not sure there could ever be enough time to fully enjoy all of the art and history in this wonderful place. According to the passage, we can infer  that   _  .\n\nA.

Why doesn't ever-greater wealth promote ever-greater happiness? It is a question that dates at least to the appearance in 1958 ofThe Wealthy Society by John Kenneth Galbraith, who died recently at 97. The Wealthy Societyis a modern classic because it helped describe a new moment in the human condition. For most of history, \"hunger, sickness, and cold\" threatened nearly everyone, Galbraith wrote. \"Poverty   was found everywhere in that world. Obviously it is not of ours.\" After World War II, the fear of another Great Depression gave way to an economic growth. In the 1930s unemployment had averaged 18.2 percent; in the 1950s it was 4.5 percent. To Galbraith, materialism   had gone mad and would cause discontent. Through advertising, companies conditioned consumers to buy things they didn't really want or need. Because so much spending was artificial, it would be unsatisfying. Meanwhile, government spending that would make everyone better off was being cut down because people wrongly considered government only as \"a necessary bad.\" It's often said that only the rich are getting ahead; everyone else is standing still or falling behind. Well, there are many undeserving rich -- overpaid chief managers, for instance. But over any meaningful period, most people's incomes are increasing. From 1995 to 2004, people feel \"squeezed\" because their rising incomes often don't satisfy their rising wants -- for bigger homes, more health care, more education, and faster Internet connections. The other great disappointment is that it has not got rid of insecurity. People regard job stability as part of their standard of living. As company unemployment increased, that part has gradually become weaker. More workers fear they've become \" _ ,\" as Louis Uchitelle puts it in his book by the same name. Because so much previous suffering and social conflict resulted from poverty, the arrival of widespread wealth suggestedutopian  possibilities. Up to a point, wealth succeeds. There is much less physical suffering than before. People are better off. Unfortunately, wealth also creates new complaints. Advanced societies need economic growth to satisfy the multiplying wants of their citizens. But the search for growth cause new anxieties and economic conflicts that disturb the social order. Wealth sets free the individual, promising that everyone can choose a unique way to self-accomplishment. But the promise is so unreasonable that it leads to many disappointments and sometimes inspires choices that have anti-social consequences, including family breakdown. Figures indicate that happiness has not risen with incomes. Should we be surprised? Not really. We've simply confirmed an old truth: the seeking of wealth does not always end with happiness. According to Galbraith, people feel discontented because   _  .\n\nA. materialism has run wild in modern society\nB. they are in fear of another Great Depression\nC. public spending hasn't been cut down as expected\nD. the government has proved to be necessary but ugly\n\nYour answer: \\box{A}",

She started working as a reporter for theAtlanta Journalnewspaper in 1922. One photograph of Ms. Mitchell, called Peggy, shows her talking to a group of young college boys. She was only about one and a half meters tall. The young men _ her, but she seems very happy and sure of herself. The tour guide explains: \"Now in this picture Peggy is interviewing some boys from Georgia Tech, asking them such questions as 'Would you really marry a woman who works?' And today it'd be 'Would you marry one who doesn't?' \" The Margaret Mitchell House is a building that once contained several apartments. Now we enter the first floor apartment where Ms. Mitchell lived with her husband, John Marsh. They made fun of the small apartment by calling it \"The Dump \" .

She read so many books that he bought her a typewriter and said it was time for her to write her own book. Our guide saysGone with the Windbecame a huge success.

Growing up, I had people telling me I was too slow, though, with an IQ of 150 at 17, I'm anything but stupid. The fact was that I was found to have ADIID . Anxious all the time, I was unable to keep focused for more than an hour at a time. However, when something did interest me, I could become absorbed.

She loved them very much, but two girls would fight with each other from their earliest years. As they grew older, they became total strangers. They had no contact with each other when they were adults. This caused the mother great pain. Then, later, she had an idea. She decided to write a letter to them. In this letter, she told them how much she loved them, and how she wanted them to love each other in this way. She also gave them news of herself and some guidance on how to live happier lives. When the letter was ready, she wrote out one copy for each daughter, but these copies were special. Each copy contained only every second sentence of the original letter: the copy for one daughter had only the even   sentences, and the other daughter's copy contained only the odd sentences. Neither contained the fullness of the mother's message. When the two daughters received their letters, they were puzzled. To understand the half-letter, they would have to put the two letters together and read them as one, which meant they must approach one another again in love and respect. But they each blamed the other for not helping them when trying to read the half-letter. For a long time, the mother waited in vain. Then one day, when the mother had almost given up hope, there was a knock at the door. There they stood, together. \"We've come home,\" they said at the same time. \"We've finally put our letters together, and we've come to say how much we love you, Mum.\" Then she hugged them both, tears of joy streaming down her cheeks, and welcomed them back home.

But what your dreams can offer and tell you about yourself will be well worth _ Here are some tips to help recall your dreams: 1. Before going to bed, keep a clear mind. Tell yourself that \"I will remember my dreams when I wake up\". This is actually a proven and effective way to recall your dreams. 2. Have a regular bedtime and wake-up time. Make this your routine. Going to bed and waking up at a regular time every day could aid in dream recollection. 3. Avoid alcohol consumption and taking medicine before going to bed. These things may prevent you from remembering your dreams. 4. Keep a pencil and a notebook next to your bed so that they will be within reach as soon as you wake up. Having a small lamp by your bedside is also a good idea, so you wake up in the middle of the night and can record your dreams immediately. 5. Do not get out of bed immediately. Upon waking from a dream, lie still in your bed, keeping your eyes closed and moving as little as possible. Let your mind wander among the images of what you have just dreamed. 6. Write down as many details in your dreams as you can, no matter how seemingly unimportant they may be. Do not judge the content or worry if they make sense. 7. Sometimes it may help to draw pictures. A picture is worth a thousand words, as the saying goes. Even if you are not an artist, a simple drawing can help to recall details of your dreams.

So far as the children were concerned, they had a mystery about him that stirred their imagination. He stirred Maggie's anger, however, so that she often said to her husband, \"It's mercy that brother of yours doesn't come oftener.\" In fact James came once a year, unexpectedly, around eight o'clock in the evening, and he stayed for six hours of close discussion with his brother. His arrival was a signal to the children that their bedtime would be delayed. Not that he ever spoke to them or played with them. He took no notice of them, as if he was unable to see children, at least until the time came for him to go. Instead, after his first greeting and a careless kiss, James took no notice of Maggie either, except to add, \"You'll be getting on with the supper, Maggie.\" Such was his regard for her. Maggie paid him back in her own way. She kept the children up, the four of them, to keep her company, she said, but of course they sang and made a noise and broke the endless sound of James's voice. Very late, they dropped off to sleep in their chairs. Then, when James was about to go, Maggie woke them up and so more or less forced him to part with four shillings before he left. That gave her some satisfaction, for James, though rich, was mean. He always went home by the last train, just after two o'clock. Maggie's children secretly stared at their uncle. They could not forget that he had, in their mother's words, \"lost two wives and taken a third, \" They wondered about those two unfortunate lost ladies. They asked each other what their fate had been, and if neither could ever be found again. James never brought his third wife with him nor ever mentioned her. The children decided that he must be so frightened of losing her that he never allowed her outside the door. What do we know about James' behavior?\n\nA.

Each one is searching for the one great idea that could make his web company click in a big way.And they are trying all kinds of tricks to attract people towards their websites.While some websites offer sounds,cartoons and amazing photos on screen to make their sites almost a movie-like experience for the viewers,others provide free downloads and competitions. A company in California,US,has decided to offer online smells to people who visit its website. That is,if a pizza image comes on screen,your nose will catch the smell of bread and cheese!All you need to do is to connect a device called\"iSmell\"with your computer.This smart little device contains some chemicals that can create different kinds of smells. The company has invented software that changes the chemical composition of different smells into digital signals .An onscreen image,which is programmed with the proper digital signal,will start the\"iSmell\" device.The device will use the software to change' the digital signal again and let go of the correct smell.This device reads the digital smell code from the website and creates the proper smell from its store of chemicals.This smell is then made to blow softly in the direction of the user with the support of a small fan. In order to let go of the correct smell,the company has created a\"Scent Registry\",which contains a digital index of thousands of smells.The company plans to allow website developers to integrate the proper smells in digital code to their games and images.The company is also hoping that Hollywood filmmakers will use the smell technology in their movies.Imagine audiences getting the smell of rocket fuel as a spacecraft takes off on the cinema screen!Of course,filmmakers will have to be careful not to shoot in dirty neighborhoods,which have a lot of rubbish lying arounD. What does\"iSmell\"do after being started by the onscreen image?\n\nA. It reads the smell code and sends it to the user.\nB. It blows the smell to the user with the help of a fan.\nC.

C. almost 3,000 years ago. Many different sports, such as boxing, running and throwing the discus were played there, though there were much fewer sports than in the modern Olympics. People fr0m all over Greece came and watched the Games at the foot of Olympus, and even those at war stopped fighting and went on with the games. The Games were held every five years, until they were ordered to stop by the Romans in 383 A. D. It was nearly 1500 years since the Romans stopped the Olympics. Later in 1884 Baron Pierre de Coubertin thought it's possible to start the Games again, so he invited sportsmen from different countries to the competition. Many others agreed to his proposal   and in 1896 the first modern Olympics was held in Greece. Only 50,000 people watched the Games, but the rest of the world soon became enthusiastic   about them and from 1900 the Games were held every four years in a different country. 0nly three Olympics were crossed out because of the wars 1916,1940 and 1944.

Most of our stuff is made from heavy materials and metals.So part of the routine for us when we fly is getting stopped by security.Our jewelry sets off the alarms,and we've become accustomed to arriving early to go through private screenings.Most of the time,it's not troublesome. However,on our recent trip to a Paris trade show,we were stopped at security and asked to empty our bags. One of the agents walked over to another agent and they started whispering to each other.Both gentlemen came back,and one of them then told us that it seemed that we were carrying a very dangerous object. My sister and I just said,\"Huh?\"Of course,we were a little concerned,thinking that maybe someone put something dangerous in one of our bags when we weren't looking. One of the agents then started to unpack our bags.I kept asking what he was 1ooking for and then the object in question finally appeared.It was our Cosima necklace.It's a piece of jewelry,with large,metal triangular spikes. My sister and I 1ooked at each other and breathed a huge sigh of relief.We started laughing and explained to the two male agents that it was just a necklace from our collection.not a weapon of mass destruction.They thought we were lying,and one agent kept repeating that he believed it was a weapon. I tried to explain that we were jewelry designers going to a trade show,and this was simply a piece from our collection.But the agents didn't _ it.Then a few women guards came over to assist.One of the women guards was holding an earring up to her ear and another was trying on a ring.Apparently,they liked our stuff. It was only at this point that the male guards gave up.And I think they also got tired of listening to a bunch of women talk about jewelry.They let us through. We took the names of the women agents and sent them a piece of jewelry when we got back to say thanks. According to this passage,which of the following statements is NOT true?\n\nA.

It is the day when everyone goes back home to spend the day with his family, to have the traditional Thanksgiving dinner of roast turkey, to talk about old times. This is a story of Thanksgiving Day and of one man's efforts, under rather special circumstances, to carry on these traditions. Old Pete took his seat this day on his usual bench in Union Square. Every Thanksgiving Day for nine years, Pete had taken this same seat exactly at one o'clock, and each time the same pleasant thing had happened. But this time Pete had come here more from habit than from hunger. Certainly today Pete was not hungry. He had just had a dinner so enormous that he could hardly breathe. The buttons on his ragged shirt and coat were about to burst. He was so full of soup, oysters, roast turkey, apple pie, ice cream, and a dozen other rich foods that the November breeze and the first light fall of snow felt cool and pleasant to his face. The meal had been completely unexpected. He had been passing one of the large homes on Fifth Avenue, where there lived two rich old ladies. It seems that it was their custom each Thanksgiving to place a servant at the front entrance with orders to bring in the first hungry looking person that passed and then give him a Thanksgiving dinner of everything he could eat. On this particular Thanksgiving Day, Pete had passed, the servant had brought him in, and, before Pete knew it, he was being served like a king with more food than he could eat. Pete sat on the bench now, hardly able to move. He happened to look to the left and there in the distance he saw the Old Gentleman coming toward him. He wanted to get up and run, but he was so full of food that he stayed right there. Every Thanksgiving Day for nine years, the Old Gentleman had come here, and found Pete on this same bench, and then taken him to a restaurant and bought him a Thanksgiving dinner. It was a kind of tradition which the Old Gentleman, who had no family and lived alone, had tried to continue. The old man was tall and thin and sixty years old. He was aristocratic looking and he always dressed in black. His hair was whiter and thinner than it had been the year before, and he leaned more heavily on his cane than he used to. \"How do you do!\" said the Old Gentleman. \"I am glad to see that the changes of another year have permitted you to move in health through this beautiful world.\" Each time the Old Gentleman had said exactly this same thing. It was part of the tradition. Old Pete, too, began to feel as though he himself was now a part of the tradition, and he therefore did not have the courage to tell the old man that he had already eaten. This dinner seemed to mean so much to the Old Gentleman. \"Thank you, sir,\" said Old Pete at last. \"I'll go with you gladly. I'm very hungry sir.\" Together the Old Gentleman and Pete walked south to the same restaurant where each year Pete had his Thanksgiving dinner. They sat at the same table. The Old Gentleman seemed pleased and happy. When the waiter brought dish after dish of food to Pete, the Old Gentleman sat quietly and smiled. Under the circumstance, Pete had to eat. It was part of the tradition, and so he ate like a hero. Soup, oysters, roast turkey, pie, he ate everything, although when he entered the restaurant even the smell of more food almost made him sick. At last Pete leaned back with the battle won. \"Thank you sir,\" he said, with some effort, \" for a fine dinner.\" They parted as they did each year at the door, the Old Gentleman going south, Pete north. Around the corner, Pete stopped for a moment, felt a terrible pain in his stomach, then fell to the sidewalk unconscious. A little later an ambulance came. In the hospital they discovered that he had had an attack of indigestion. An hour later, another ambulance brought the Old Gentleman to the same hospital. At first they thought it was also indigestion but later one of the nurses said, \"That nice old gentleman over there-- you wouldn't think that it was a case of starvation. Proud old family, I suppose. He told me that he hadn't eaten a thing for three days.\" Why didn't Old Pete refuse the invitation from the Old Gentleman?\n\nA. Because he felt he had more room for food.\nB. Because he realized he was involved in the tradition.\nC. Because he felt moved by the Old Gentlemen's generosity.\nD. Because he didn't dare to tell the old man he had already eaten.\n\nYour answer: \\box{D}",

They may choose a name because it honors a family member. Or they may choose a name just because they like it. A website called Baby Center lists some unusual names given to American babies born last year. Some were named for characters in old stories, such as Hero, Thor and Ulysses. Other people named their babies after kinds of food, like actress Gwyneth Paltrow. She named her daughter Apple. Other people named their babies Banana, Pumpkin and Cookie. Still some babies were named for places. These included Brazil, India and Rome. Some parents used names of famous people from history such as Newton and Hannibal. Other parents named their babies after flowers or the weather. These babies were named Buttercup, Iris, Sunshine and Thunder. Recording artists and movie actors influence some parents' choices of names. Babies were named Beyonce, Charlize, Reda, Pierce, Shajira and Whitney. Movie actors themselves often give their babies unusual names. For example, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt named their baby daughter Shiloh. Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes named their little girl Suri. Some American parents do not want unusual names. They want their baby's name to honor their religious faith. Such names include Abraham for boys or Sarah for girls. And many people give their babies the same name as a family member or good friend. The United States Social Security Administration once published a list of the most popular names for American girls and boys born.

As a major leader of the government, I have the responsibility and I have the confidence, too.\" He made the remarks while answering a listener's question during a radio broadcast by China National Radio. Steps taken in the past month, including price controls to curb speculation  and monetary tightening , had started to produce results, he said.       The government plans to build 10 million units of affordable housing in 2011, up from this year's target of 5.8 million. China will also increase efforts to curb speculation in the housing market, mainly through monetary policies and stricter use of land, Wen said, without giving details. Wen said the country had a good agricultural supply base which gave the government confidence that it could stabilize prices. In a bid to control inflation, the government has also increased the bank reserve requirement ratio six times and lifted interest rate twice this year, he added.     Further, authorities have introduced many measures including cutting fees for transportation of agriculture products and controlling food price rise strictly.     The overall price level, especially of major consumer goods, has now begun to drop, Wen said.    \"The fundamental way to stabilize pri ces is to achieve a balance of supply and demand, which requires continuous development of agriculture,\" said premier, adding that the central government has worked out measures to increase agricultural production.

Jesse Martin does not have to imagine: he is living in it. On Dec. 7, 1998, at 17 years old, Jesse set sail from Melbourne, Australia on his boat, attempting to become the youngest person to sail alone and nonstop around the world. He sailed south of New Zealand, through the South Pacific, around South America, north on the Atlantic, back south past Africa, through the Indian Ocean and back to Melbourne. Even as a young child, Jesse had been an adventurer who traveled all over Europe and Asia with his parents. Born in Munich, Germany in 1981, he moved to Australia with his family when he was only two years old. They moved close to a rainforest in Cow Bay, about 3500kms north of Melbourne, where they built a small house with no electricity or running water. Jesse grew up at the beach enjoying the outdoors to its fullest. At 14, he sailed for the first time with his father and brother, Beau. It was after this trip that he began to dream about sailing around the world. Jesse's family played an important role. \"I was made to believe I could do anything.\" he says. Although, he says, there were others that were not so encouraging or supportive, \"People that I looked up to, respected and trusted told me I couldn't. Thankfully, I trusted myself. There were people that said that the boat couldn't be ready by the time I had to leave.\" However, through perseverance and belief in himself he was able to do what many told him was impossible. On Oct.31, 1999, more than 10 months after he set sail, Jesse Martin went down in history as the youngest person to sail around the world alone, nonstop and unassisted. What can we learn from Jesse Martin's story?\n\nA. Interest leads to success.\nB. A strong belief will make a person stronger.\nC. Life is an unusual adventure we should enjoy.\nD.

For all these years, he had never thought about the box. But one day the old woman got very sick and the doctor said she would never get better.

These moments used to haunt   me and my face would turn as red as a big tomato.   It wasn't until I was in my late teens, working at a hotel that things changed for me. I took a year off in between high school and university, because like many people my age I had  ly no idea what I wanted to do, and I didn't want to waste $ 5,000 on a university tuition .   I tried to keep silent at my new job, avoiding the other employees. All of them didn't care about me except for one girl. She kept at me, telling me stories of her weekend and how she loved snowboarding, something I was interested in as well. She was the type of warm personality where people were immediately drawn to her, and soon enough I found myself looking forward to our coffee breaks and snowboarding after work. The more I hung out with her, the more I realized that this girl, who seemed to have it all together, was in fact just like me, except for one major difference. She laughed at herself. One night after work we were snowboarding and she fell down carelessly resulting in a mouth full of snow. Instead of getting embarrassed she jumped right up laughing loudly at how ridiculous she must have looked. As time went on, her warm personality began to wear off  on me and soon enough I had a mini-breakthrough. I'm not saying that I no longer find myself in embarrassing situations; I've just learned how to handle them differently. Just a few months ago I walked out of a bathroom unaware of the fact that my skirt was tucked  in my underwear. But instead of rushing back to the bathroom I calmly pulled it out and continued on my way shaking my head and smiling. When she fell down carelessly resulting in a mouth full of snow, the girl  _  .\n\nA. just laughed and joked about herself\nB. tried to hide her pain through laughing\nC. was quite upset and didn't know what to do\nD. couldn't help becoming excited\n\nYour answer: \\box{A}",

My professional experience and my awareness of your high reputation and great achievements have led me to want to work for World Destiny. Since 1998 I have focused on computer-system design and training. As Systems Administrator for Newport Museum for the past two years, I have directed accounting, capital campaign and publication production. We designed the system from scratch, developing all applications, policies, procedures, and training programs. I was well prepared for such a challenge by my previous positions as a Systems Support Specialist and MicroComputer Assistant for the Imperial Corporation of America. Over the years, I have worked with Novell, using programs including dBase, Wordstar and Microsoft Word. This familiarity with a variety of hardware and software has helped me to get up to speed on nearly any computer with a minimum training period. Additional experience in other fields also adds my value to World Destiny. As a Market Research Coordinator for Cushman & Wakefield of California, I not only researched and maintained  a comprehensive database of Silicon Valley, but also produced statistical and written reports that support Cushman & Wakefield's reputation. Previously, I organized companywide annual sales meetings for Qualogy, Inc. Mr. Smith, while this experience more than qualifies me to join any number of successful companies, it is my personal goals that lead to my interest in being part of the World Destiny team. I believe my computer, promotional, and organizational skills, fueled by my beliefs, make World Destiny and me right for each other. Can we arrange an interview at your earliest convenience? I will call within the next week to arrange a meeting.

Meanwhile, the state's investment  in public higher education has dropped over the past three decades, and now ranks 22nd in the country.That's despite having the country's largest public higher education system, the report said. \"It's a collapse ,\" said Thomas Mortenson, author of the report, who is an independent analyst living in Iowa and a senior scholar at the Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Higher Education in Washington, D. C. \"Ranking 49th out of 50 states is an indication that shows the quality of the state's educational has become much worse in recent decades.\" Mortenson said in the report.As of 2007, California ranked 14th in the United States in terms of college educated members of the workforce over 25 years of age, a drop from eighth place in 1981, the report showed. Mortenson said that California has never been the state of high status in education and economy while other states have made greater gains in building a college-educated workforce. The California Faculty Association is using the report's findings to criticize Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's proposed funding cuts for education. Struggling with a 14.8-billion-dollar state budget deficit , Schwarzenegger has proposed a combination of sales tax increases, borrowing and major budget cuts, including cutting billions of dollars from the state's education budget.

Every day they are busy earning money. They don't act in the romantic ways that I read in books or I see on TV. My father has a bad temper. When he's tired from the hard work, it is easy for him to lose his temper. One day, my mother was sewing a quilt  . \"Mom, may I ask you a question?\" I said. \"What?\" \"Is there love between you and Dad?\" I asked her in a very low voice. My mother stopped her work and raised her head in surprise. She didn't answer immediately. Then she continued to sew the quilt. I was very worried because I thought I had hurt her. But at last I heard my mother say the following words: \"Susan, look at the thread  . Sometimes it appears, but most of it disappears in the quilt. It makes the quilt strong. If life is a quilt, then love should be a thread. It can hardly be seen, but it's really there. Love is inside.\" I couldn't understand her until the next spring. My dad got sick suddenly. My mum had to stay with him in the hospital for a month. When they returned, they both looked very pale. _ . After they were back, every day in the morning and dusk, my mother helped my father walk slowly on the country road. The doctor had said my father would recover in two months. But after two months he still couldn't walk by himself. All of us were worried about him. \"Dad, how are you feeling now?\" I asked. \"Susan, don't worry about me,\" he said gently. \"I just like walking with your mom. I like this kind of life.\" Looking at his eyes, I knew he loves my mother deeply. Once I thought love meant flowers, gifts and sweet kisses. But now, I understand that love is just like the thread.

Do you know some music is noise? What is noise? Noise is a loud or unwanted sound. It is also called noise pollution. Where is noise from? Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects. Scientists use a unit  of measure  called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels. Noise at this high level causes the greatest hearing loss. How do we reduce noise damage? Turn down your music player or wear ear muffs  when you are working in a noisy environment. Ear muffs for human can protect against noise pollution. Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?\n\nA. A decibel is a unit that measures sound.\nB. In fact, a decibel is also a kind of noise.\nC. A person who hates sound belongs to decibels.\nD. Machines that make loud noise are called decibels.\n\nYour answer:\n\\box{A}",

Earthquakes, heat waves, floods, volcanoes, super typhoons, blizzards  , landslides and droughts killed at least a quarter million people in 2010 - the deadliest year in more than a generation. More people were killed worldwide by natural disasters this year than have been killed in terrorism attacks in the past 40 years combined. \"It just seemed like it was back-to-back  and it came in waves,\" said Craig Fugate, who heads the US Federal Emergency Management Agency. It handled a record number of disasters in 2010. \"The term \"100-year event' really lost its meaning this year.\" And we have ourselves to blame most of the time, scientists and disaster experts say. Even though many disasters have the ring of random chance, the hand of man made this a particularly deadly, costly, extreme and strange year for everything from wild weather to earthquakes. Poor construction and development practices make earthquakes more deadly than they need be. More people live in poverty in vulnerable buildings  in crowded cities. That means that when the ground shakes, the river floods, or the tropical cyclone hits, more people die. Disasters from the Earth, such as earthquakes and volcanoes \"are pretty much constant,\" said Andreas Schraft, vice president of catastrophic perils for the Geneva-based insurance giant Swiss Re. \"All the change that's made is man-made.\" The January earthquake that killed well more than 220,000 people in Haiti is a perfect example. Port-au-Prince has nearly three times as many people - many of them living in poverty- and more poorly built shanties  ,than it did 25 years ago. So had the same quake hit in 1985 instead of 2010; total deaths would have probably been in the 80,000 range, said Richard Olson, director of disaster risk reduction at Florida International University. Climate scientists say Earth's climate also is changing thanks to man-made global warming, bringing extreme weather, such as heat waves and flooding. The excessive  amount of extreme weather that dominated 2010 is a classic sign of man-made global warming that climate scientists have long warned about. They calculate that the killer Russian heat wave - setting a national record of 111 degrees - would happen once every 100,000 years without global warming. Data show that 18 countries broke their records for the hottest day ever. \"The Earth strikes back in response to bad human decision-making,\" said Debarati Guha Sapir.\" \"It's almost as if the policies, the government policies and development policies, are helping the Earth strike back instead of protecting from it. We've created conditions where the slightest thing the Earth does is really going to have a surprising impact.\" White House science adviser John Holdren said we should get used to climate disasters or do something about global warming. \"The science is clear that we can expect more and more of these kinds of damaging events unless and until society has sharply reduced the amount of heat-trapping gases and particles .\" What is the real concern of the writer of this article?\n\nA. The major causes of natural disasters.\nB. The human unawareness of environment protection.\nC. The harmonious relationship between humans and nature.\nD.

They manufacture cars, work in space, explore oceans, clean up oil spills and investigate dangerous environments. And now, scientists at the University of Manchester are using a robot as a laboratory partner. The researchers at the university created the robot in 2009 and named it Adam. Despite the name, Adam is not a humanoid robot. It is about the size of a car. Adam was built to do science and make discoveries. Ross King is the leader of the University of Manchester research team. He says the robot made a discovery about yeast , a kind of fungus  used in science as a model for human cells. \"Adam hypothesized certain functions of genes within yeast and experimentally tested these hypothesizes and confirmed them. So it both hypothesized and confirmed new scientific knowledge.\" Adam's success as a scientist led to the creation of another robot scientist named Eve. Researchers developed Eve to design and test drugs for tropical and neglected diseases. These diseases kill and infect millions of people each year. Drug development is slow and costly. Experts say it can take more than 10 years and about $1 billion to discover and develop new medicines. Drug manufacturers are unlikely to get their investment money back. So the University of Manchester developed a low-cost test that shows whether or not a chemical is likely to be made into an effective medicine. Mr. King says that other drug testing methods were not very effective. \"How it works conventionally is you use robotics as well and you have a large collection of possible drugs. You test every single compound. And you start at the beginning of your library and continue until the end, and stop. So it's not a very intelligent process. The robotics doesn't learn anything as it goes along, even if it's tested a million compounds, it still doesn't have any expectation of what will happen next when it tests a new compound.\" Mr. King says that Eve is different because the robot learns as it tests different compounds. He says the robot is designed to ignore compounds that it thinks unlikely to be good. It will only test the compounds which have a good chance of working. Eve has discovered that a compound known to be effective against cancer might also be used to fight against malaria and other tropical diseases. Mr. King says he hopes to completely automate the drug testing process with robots like Eve to create and test new chemicals. But he says humans remain in control of the manufacturing process. Scientists now are using a robot to  _  .\n\nA. manufacture cars\nB. work in the laboratory\nC. work in space\nD. explore oceans\n\nYour answer: \\box{B}",

But Echo had one failing; she was fond of talking, and whether in chat or argument, would have the last word. As she was good company, she and Zeus became good friends. However, Zeus' wife, Hera, became jealous. She followed Zeus to the earth to find out what he was doing and Zeus asked Echo to distract Hera until he could escape. Later when Hera discovered she had been tricked, she became very angry. She turned on Echo and said, \"You shall lose the use of your tongue because you cheated me. You'll have the last word, bur no longer have the power to speak first.\" So from that moment on, Beautiful Echo was hardly able to hold a conversation because she could only repeat the last words of those around her. She became very embarrassed and hid herself deep in the woods. One day a handsome young man called Narcissus came into the woods. He had been hunting deer and lost his way. However, the moment Echo saw him, she fell in love with him. She followed him, wishing to tell him but unable to begin a conversation. Oh, how she wished she could speak first. Unfortunately, Narcissus was far too busy worrying about where his companions might be and how he could find his way home. Eventually Narcissus, with Echo following behind along, came to a pool of water in the middle of the woods. Feeling thirsty, Narcissus bent down to drink. As he did so, he saw a beautiful creature in the water staring up at him. He immediately bent over and said to him, \"I love you!\" Echo, nearby, and seeing her chance, immediately responded \".... I love you!\" But it was too late. Narcissus was already in love, with himself. The stranger seemed to rise up closer to Narcissus who was so involved that he entirely failed to notice Echo. \"I want to stay and look at this beautiful sight forever,\" he whispered dreamily to himself.\"... Forever,\" repeated Echo sadly. \"Come here,\" called Narcissus to his reflection as he moved his head and the creature seemed to move away. \"...Here.\" responded Echo. Narcissus bent back down to see his reflection more clearly. \"So beautiful! I've never seen anything so beautiful!\" \"....So beautiful!\" responded Echo truthfully. Narcissus remained by the water refusing all Echo's silent offers of food and drink until he died. Where he had been, a flower grew in his place, as beautiful as Narcissus himself. As for Echo, from that time forward, she also didn't eat or drink till she turned to rocks and all that was left was her voice. Even now you can still hear Echo trying to attract Narcissus' attention by repeating his words and still see Narcissus as a beautiful flower growing near a pool.

When I was in Senior Two, I met the new school basketball coach, Brian Pawloski.I thought I was certain to be selected for the school team since I had been in it the year before.I showed up to the tryouts and put out about 90% effort since I thought I'd make it with no problem.That was a big mistake. Brian Pawloski is the hardest      working coach I have ever met.He didn't expect 100% effort, he expected 200% effort.One example: he once made us do 40 suicide drills for the 40 lay      ups   we missed in a game.Some think this is crazy, but it isn't.After this conditioning practice, as we were getting a cup of cold water to drink, I said, \"coach, that was the best practice I ever had.\" I was completely sincere.This man was and is the person who influenced me most at my high school.He expects us to be excellent not just on the court but in the classroom.If I am not working on basketball, I am reading a book that he thinks will help us better understand life's challenges, including Wooden, Coach, and The Screwtape Letters. In the first two years I slacked off, not putting forth my full potential.Now, unlike the coaches of my youth, this man was interested in how he did off the court.He always made sure I kept up with my studies and was able to be trusted.I can honestly say that no other coach has given me so much advice on how to succeed in basketball, but more importantly, in life.My school is lucky to have such a great person to teach, coach and influence their students.I will always remember my high      school basketball days as one of the hardest times I have ever worked in my life not only in basketball but in my growth as an individual.

Some people subscribe to as many as two or three different newspapers. But why do people read newspapers?     Five hundred years ago,news of important happenings--battles lost and won,kings or rulers overthrown  or killed--took months and even years to travel from one country to another. The news passed by word of mouth and was never accurate. Today we can read in our newspapers of important events that occur in far away countries on the same day they happen.   Apart from supplying news from all over the world,newspapers give us a lot of other useful information. There are weather reports, radio, television and film guides, book reviews, stories, and of course, advertisements. The bigger ones are put in by large companies to bring attention to their products. They pay the newspapers thousands of dollars for the advertising space, but it is worth the money, for news of their products goes into almost every home in the country. For those who produce newspapers, advertisements are also very important. Money earned from advertisements makes it possible for them to sell their newspapers at a low price and still make a profit.

It's said that the material came originally from Nimes, a city in France. These jeans were particularly created for the sailors, who loved wearing jeans very much. These jeans could be worn when wet and it could even be rolled over with ease. This was particularly useful when the sailors were busy with their everyday work. Our favorite pair of blue, jeans was originally worn by workers particularly during World War II. Perhaps the strong and durable  look made these blue jeans popular among all the factory workers. A strange thing that can be noticed happened in the early period of the 1950s when blue jeans worn by teens were considered to be a form of being against others. Besides, adults who wore blue jeans were not allowed to enter a movie theatre. It was only during the 1960s that blue jeans were accepted as a fashion trend in the United States of America. Movie stars wore them in films and in public. Many young people follow them. The different looks of the regular blue jeans which are enjoyed by people were introduced by the mid 1950s. It was Donald Freeland who gave jeans a whole new look and brought it to the front. Originally, jeans were always worn loose. At first, jeans worn by men had the zipper on the front. However, for women, it was on the side. By the late 1960's , the zipper finally was on the front side for women as well. Today, there are many new designs that are being created by fashion designers to meet the increasing demands from jean lovers! A pair of basic blue jeans, however, is one such piece of clothing that will never go out of fashion! When you open one's cupboard, there is always one pair of jeans one likes best.

Sixteen years ago I learned a lesson. I got in a taxi, and we took off for Grand Central Station. We were driving in the right lane   when all of a sudden, a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us. My taxi driver used his brakes  , the tires made a loud noise, and at the very last moment our car stopped just 3cm from the back of the other car. I couldn't believe it. But then I couldn't believe what happened next. The driver of the other car, the guy who almost caused a big accident, turned his head around and he started shouting at us. I couldn't believe it! My taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy. So, I said, \"Why did you just do that? This guy could have killed us!\" And this is when my taxi driver told me what I now call, \"The Law of the Garbage Truck\". He said, \"Many people are like garbage trucks. They run around full of garbage, full of anger and disappointment. As their garbage piles up, they look for a place to dump   it. And if you let them, they'll dump it on you. So I started thinking how often I let Garbage Trucks run right over me and how often I take their garbage and spread it to other people. I began to see Garbage Trucks. I see _ people are carrying.

This name comes from the fact that Vancouver is  the third most filmed city in North America behind Los Angeles and New York City. Vancouver became known as a filming destination because it is a perfect stand-in  for other  cities. Shot from the right angles, the downtown core could look like New York, Seattle, Boston or a variety of other places. Also, the architectural smorgasbord  that is Vancouver, the low Canadian  dollar, and generous tax subsidies  attracted film production companies to the city. Many would accuse Vancouver of simply being a stand-in city, and not really being of any  significance to the overall culture of film production. However, this has proven not to be the case. The  creative establishment in the film sector has realized that Vancouver is more than just a stand-in; it is a city that is filled with talent. Earlier this year Pixar Studios opened an animation studio in Vancouver. The animators made famous  by such hits as Toy Story, Monsters Inc, and Wall-E, demonstrated that Vancouver is now a major player  in the film industry by opening up shops in the city. Amir Nasrabadi, the General Manager for Pixar Canada said the company decided to open an office in  the city because of the \"very mature , high-quality talent pool, driven primary by the strength of  the industry and great local universities and schools\"  For now the studio will work as a satellite branch of Pixar's California studios, but future plans  include the Vancouver studio taking on its own feature films. The British Columbia Film Commissioner,  Susan Croome, told CTV News in an interview that \"Pixar's announcement is  ly fantastic\". When  asked if this expansion of Vancouver's film industry was the result of favorable exchange rates, she  responded that it wasn't, and the company was making plans for the long term. It is suggested in the passage that Vancouver   _  .\n\nA. is more than a stand-in city for making films\nB. is best known for its animation films\nC. has become a major film producer\nD. is a poor but talented city\n\nYour answer: \\box{A}\n",

Northern spotted owls are known to be curious. When seeing you, these owls will come down close and check you out. The northern spotted owl has been a savior of old-growth forests. Old-growth forests are forests that have been around for a long time without significant disturbances. One way the spotted owl has become a protector of old-growth forests is simply by being there. The northern spotted owl has become endangered, and so to protect them from dying out, the government has to protect their habitat. So now any destruction of old-growth forests is illegal. Another way the owls help their habitat is by eating small animals. This helps create a balance in the forest. So, if the northern spotted owl is in a habitat that is protected by laws, why are they still endangered? Unfortunately, a cousin of the northern spotted owl has moved into its neighborhood. The bigger, more aggressive \"barred owl\" has grown in population and due to loss of the forests they lived in on the East Coast of the United States, they have begun to move to the west coast. These owls are taking the food source and pushing northern spotted owls out of their own home. Although the barred owl is able to live in different habitats, the northern spotted owl can only live in old-growth forests. Many government officials have been at a loss to find an answer to the difficult question, \"What do we do with the non-native barred owls?\" Some methods include shooting them. It is a difficult problem to deal with. Can you think of any possible solutions?

The 19th century of steam was about to give way to the 20th century of oil and electricity. Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, only 41 years old in 1900, provided a scientific basis for the idea that progress was not to be stopped, determined by natural law. And almost everybody thought that the development would continue to be as slow as that in the 19th century. Inventions like the railroad or the telegraph or the typewriter enabled people to live their everyday lives a little more conveniently. No one could have guessed that new ideas would storm the world with a force and frequency at an amazing pace. This high-speed attack of new ideas and technologies seemed to make people believe in the old dreams of a perfect life on earth, of a safe world in which natural disasters would be controlled. But the fast progress was accompanied by something against mankind's will. Murders in Sarajevo  in 1914 led to the Great War, which did more than destroy a generation of Europeans. The Great War was most commonly called so until the beginning of World War II when it was renamed World War I. Hitler rose to power in the 1930's. It was this very man who ordered the attack of prefix = st1 /Poland, only to meet with his failure whenGreat BritainandFrancemade war onGermany. On December 7, 1941, the Japanese bombed the American naval base at Pearl harbor. Americans decided to enter the war, and World War II was now truly a world war. But civilization was not crushed  by the two great wars, and from the ruins people built a way of life again. The citizens of the 20th century felt free to reinvent themselves. In that task they were aided by two far-reaching developments-Psychoanalysis  and the Bomb. Why was the Great War renamed as World War I?\n\nA. Because it destroyed a generation of Europeans.\nB. Because it was not only a war but a human disaster.\nC. Because it was followed by the other world war.\nD. Because it was influenced by new ideas.\n\nYour answer: \\box{C}",

Early in the Five dynasties, a man named Li Ye used to make and fly a kite in the emperor's court. He once attached a whistle made of bamboo to the kite. Sound was let out when the kite was flying. The kite was named after  Zheng, a kind of Chinese music instrument. Then it was named Fengzheng in Chinese. The earliest kite in the world was made by Motse, a famous Chinese philosopher, who lived 2,300 years ago, for military   purposes. He spent three years making an eagle and managed to fly it. The eagle was later regarded as the first kite in the world. Kite-flying became a recreation probably from the Tang dynasty when the royal family and people of the highest class were addicted to it. It was said that the Emperor Xuanzong in the Tang Dynasty once was interested in a kite named Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea flying in the air. Later, the paper-made kite was invented, which cost less and spread quickly among the common people. As time went on, kites flew to various countries in the world. 'The well-known British scientist, Dr. Needham, once described kites as an important scientific invention which spread to Europe from China in his book, A History of China's Science and Technology. The invention of the kite inspired men's dream of flying and led to the invention of the airplane. Which of the following statements might Dr. Needham agree with?\n\nA. The Chinese people first tried to invent airplanes.\nB. The Chinese spread the idea of flying to Europe.\nC. The invention of kites in China is great.\nD.

They are dying because they are losing a great deal of habitat due to human incursion and global warming.  They are dying because of starvation as well.  With the sea ice they depend on for survival shrinking, it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to find food. An ecosystem is highly dependent on all of its parts, and removing even a single species can result in serious consequences.  Polar bears are at the top of the predators where they live.  They play an important part in the ecosystem.  They feed on seals, fish and deer.  Several other animals depend on the kill of polar bears.  The failure to save polar bears might result in loss of these predators. In addition, all large predators perform a very important function in their habitat: helping to control the populations of other species.  When an animal group loses its natural predators, its population will rise rapidly, having a direct result in population decrease of other groups.  A huge boom in population of Arctic seals would have a direct effect on the prey  of seals, and could reduce numbers of certain types of fish. This could also have a direct effect on humans, who might have to compete with Arctic seals for food supplies from fish. Lack of polar bears could eventually affect human food supply. Human beings shall save polar bears to ensure the food supply. There is no doubt that we should save polar bears.  However, there is still another question: can they be saved? This is a matter that scientists debate because of rapid degradation of the polar bear' environment in recent years due to warming temperatures.  It is estimated that if the bears cannot adapt to changing climates, they might die out before the end of the 21stcentury, with about 50% of the animals disappearing by 2050. So time is running out! There are some things that may help slow down global warming and help delay extinction of polar bears.  These include finding new energy sources that don't give off greenhouse gases and not making any more incursions into polar bear's territory. If bears can't adapt to changing climates, we will probably have lost  _  by the middle of the 21stcentury.\n\nA. half of polar bears\nB. most of polar bears\nC. 90% of polar bears\nD. all of polar bears\n\nYour answer: \\box{A}\n",

Quite simply because no one tells us how to fail so that failure becomes an experience that will lead to growth. We forget that failure is part of the human condition and that every person has the right to fail.         Most parents work hard at either preventing failure or protecting  their children  from the knowledge that they have failed. One way is to lower standards. A mother describes her child's hurriedly-made table as \"perfect\"! Even though it couldn't stand on uneven (not same in height) legs. Another way is to shift   blame. If John fails in science, his teacher is unfair or stupid.        The trouble with failure-prevention methods is that they leave a child unequipped for life in the real world. The young need to learn that no one can be best at everything, that no one can win all the time and that it's possible to enjoy a game even when you don't win. A child who's not invited to a birthday party, who doesn't make the honor roll or the baseball team feel terrible, of course. But parents should not offer a quick comfort prize or say \"It doesn't matter\" because it does. The young should be allowed to experience disappointment and be helped to master it.        Failure is never pleasurable. It hurts grown-ups and children exactly alike. But it can make a positive contribution to your life once you learn to use it. Step one is to ask  \"Why did I fail?\" Control the natural impulse   to blame someone else. Ask yourself what you did wrong, and how you can improve. If someone else can help, don't be shy about asking them. By \"protecting their children from the knowledge that they have failed\", the writer means that most parents try their best  _  .\n\nA. to let their children know that they won't fail\nB. to teach their children about knowledge of failure\nC. to provide their children with the knowledge against failure\nD. to keep their children from realizing that they failed\n\nYour answer: \\box{D}\nQuestion: If the speed of a car increases from 20 m/s to 30 m/s in 5 seconds, what is the acceleration of the car?\n\nYour answer: \\box{2}\nQuestion:  In a right triangle, one leg is 5 cm long and the other leg is 12 cm long.

Some doctors were sure the disease was air-borne; others felt that it was spread from person to person.

Do you ever stop to wonder why  you're going?  *Relax. You're making the right decision. First of all, you'll discover what interests you by taking  courses in many subjects. For example, it's hard to decide if you want to be a painter if you've never  painted any pictures; once you're in a drawing-room on campus, you'll know one way or the other.  College is also a lot of fun--after you graduate, you'll be working every weekday for 50 or so years.  And remember that college graduate earn about twice the income of those who never attended college.  *Finding the right college can be difficult. Fortunately, Johnson Review is here to help you every  step of the way.  *Researching Schools. To us, the most important decision you'll make is to choose the school that  really fits you best -- not the one that is the most competitive or has the best-equipped rooms.  *Applying to School. On JohnsonReview.com., you'll find hundreds of actual college applications and links to many more.  *Raising Your Scores. American College Test is one of the most important parts of the admission course. It's not the most important, though, and everyone needs to prepare for the best. But, if you can do better, find the right course for better scores.  *Paying for School. Most families need financial aid for the high cost of college. The problem is  that financial aid seems difficult to get and many families get caught up in the price of college rather than learning the ways to get financial aid. If you really do your research, you'll learn that you can afford to attend any college, no matter the cost.

But some of them have some wrong ideas about it. A plate of chicken is a good meal before games because it has much energy. In fact, the best meal before games should have carbohydrates . Foods like potatoes, bread, bananas are rich in it, chicken and meat are not. Carbohydrates are the best and most easily used forms of energy. The energy that you get for today's game is from what you ate yesterday. The best time to exercise is early in the morning. Morning is a good time to exercise, but it may not be suitable for you. If an afternoon or evening period suits you, and you enjoy the feeling of getting healthier, you can choose any time to exercise. There is no fixed time for you to exercise. If you drink water when you exercise, you'll get headaches and feel tired. The fact is that you must have some water during breaks when you exercise. And after exercising, you must have enough water. If you don't drink enough water, then you'll probably get headaches and feel tired. Exercising the same body part every day is the fastest way to improve strength. False! Exercising the same body part every day is the fastest way to cause problems. To improve strength, you want to work your muscles  hard, but then you need to give those muscles a day of rest. Too much exercise can cause serious problems to muscles. Girls who do strength training will make their muscles big. Wrong! We usually connect those big muscles with bodybuilders , but girls don't have enough male hormone  to make their muscles big like men. Strength training is a good way to make their muscles strong for girls. What is this passage mainly about?\n\nA. Reasons for sports and exercise.\nB. False ideas about sports and exercise.\nC.

In 2002, an Australian man went to his friend's 21st birthday party. He got drunk, _ on some steps and cut his lip. He took a picture of his injuries and shared it with his friends on an online forum. \"And sorry about the focus,\" he wrote, \"it was a selfie.\" That was the first recorded use of the word \"selfie\", according to linguistic experts at Oxford Dictionaries. On Nov 19, Oxford Dictionaries declared \"selfie\" Word of the Year for 2013, in honor of the term having taken over the world thanks to millions of smart phone self-portraits and the resulting shares on social media. So what does the choice of the word say about our culture? Mary Elizabeth Williams, writing in Salon magazine, says the word reminds us that contemporary culture is defined by our narcissism .Megan Jackson from a local newspaper points out a selfie may only focus on appearance. Selfies invite judgment based on appearance alone. What kind of cultural influence does this have on women? Erin Gloria Ryan on Jezebel says selfies teach young woman to obsess over their appearance and judge themselves on the basis of beauty rather than accomplishments. \"They're a reflection of the warped way we teach girls to see themselves as decorative,\" said Ryan. In Slate magazine, Rachel Simmons has the opposite view. She argues that selfies are an example of young women promoting themselves and taking control of their own self-presentation.

Once she lay down to try to sleep, many memories of her life in the little house kept her mind busy. She still was having trouble falling asleep. She remembered being a little girl and her dad putting the finishing touches on the house. Her mom loved the big kitchen, and she and her younger sister had their own room in the back.  It was in this, her old bedroom, that she was trying to sleep. The crying sound got louder. It didn't seem like it was outside. It sounded like it was coming from the other side of the bed. When she turned and looked, she saw her younger sister. She still looked five years old. The old woman couldn't remember her any other way, as she had died from a sickness at age five.  \"What's wrong?\" she asked her sister. \"I miss you. I am so lonely,\" answered the little girl, who was so thin you could see through her. The old lady closed her eyes and reached for her sister. That is how they found her the next day, holding her pillow and smiling.  \"She died in her sleep.\" \"It is best that way.\" Who still looked five years old?\n\nA. the old woman's little sister\nB. the house\nC. her mom and dad\nD. the bed\n\nYour answer:\n\\box{A}",

Some people need only three hours of sleep a night. Others need ten hours of sleep a night. Most Americans sleep an average   of seven to eight hours a night. After the age of fifty the average sleep time goes down to 6.5 hours a night. Most people have a bad night when they can not sleep. About one in three Americans has a problem with sleep. Many of these people can not fall sleep. This problem is called   insomnia. This is not a new problem. Many famous people in history had insomnia. Some of these people had special   ideas to another to make them sleep. Benjaming Franklin, the famous stateman   and inventor  ,had four beds. He moved from one to another to fall asleep. King Lousis XIV of France had 13 beds and hoped that he could fall asleep in one of them. Mark Twain, the famous American writer, had a different way. He lay on his side on the end of the bed!

I looked to the east--the sky was becoming grey. I got out of the car, went through a gate and walked along a dark path. There was nothing to see, but I knew it was there. After about a mile, a stranger appeared beside the path. \"Am I going the right way?\" I asked. He knew where I was going. \"Yes,\" he replied. \"you'll get there in five minutes.\" Finally, I came to some rocks and stopped. I looked over them, but it was silent and there was no sign of it. Suddenly, the rain stopped and the clouds cleared. The sun rose behind me and shone on the rocks. Far below me, the ground fell away and down to a river. I was looking across one of the wonders of the natural world -the Grand Canyon. I looked down to the Colorado River, a silver stream nearly one mile below me. If you put the two tallest buildings in the world on top of each other at the bottom of the canyon, they still would not reach the top. Then I looked across to the other side of the canyon. It was about fifteen miles away, maybe more. Finally, I looked to my left and to my right, and on both sides the canyon went far away for more than 200 miles. The Grand Canyon was not just big. It was huge! I remained by the canyon for about half an hour, and I asked myself, \"Is the Grand Canyon the greatest wonder of the natural world?\" I certainly know the answer. What do you think? Which of the follow is wrong?\n\nA. The writer visited the Grand Canyon by car in the morning.\nB. A stranger showed the writer the wrong direction of the Grand Canyon.\nC.

To them loyalty does not mean that one is devoted to a country, a place, or a leader. Loyalty means being faithful to one's family and tribe .  The Bedouin people take pride in their ancestors .  They do not admire a hero from an ordinary or poor family as much as one who comes from an honored family. They particularly respect those who have received a good name from their ancestors and then have passed it on to their children. A man's position among the black-tent people depends upon his ancestors, relatives, and fellow tribesmen. If they are honored, he is also honored. If they are disgraced, he too is disgraced. Therefore one carefully guards the honor of his family, his lineage ,and his tribe. A man can protect his family's honor by being brave and generous and by giving protection to those who ask for it. He also guards it by  carefully watching the women of his family. A Bedouin woman cannot bring honor to her family, but she can bring disgrace. Even if a woman only looks as if she has done wrong, she may be killed. The honor of her family depends upon her virtue . It can be inferred from the passage that a Bedouin man will feel disgraced if he   _   .\n\nA. does not succeed in business\nB. needs to ask for help from his brothers\nC. does nothing when a member of his family is badly treated\nD. does not help a stranger who asks for assistance\n\nYour answer:\n\\box{C}\n",

It is about the country singer, Jan Howard, and it happened in the mid 1950s. You can read about it in her autobiography , Sunshine and Shadow.

After she explained her situation to an old lady who answered the door, the lady asked her husband to help Jan carry the children into the house. These kind people allowed her to stay for two weeks until she received some money in the mail from a  . They fed and cared for Jan and her children.

EBay North America Vice President Christopher Payne says it is going to be a major step forward in social commerce, which is the still-small practice of selling products through social networks.Online retail experts aren't as certain, but eBay says the new tool makes it easier for friends and relatives to chip in   for gifts because it eliminates the headache of collecting contributions.It can also be used for family members to pitch in to buy, say, an expensive child seat for a mother. Anything on eBay that's available immediately, rather than up for bid, can be purchased this way starting today atgroupgifts.eBay.com.If members of an extended family wanted to buy a gift for one member, one person would choose a gift -- or have one recommended by eBay -- and invite family members to chip in using Facebook or e-mail.Those who wanted to join in would choose an amount to contribute (or agree to pay a requested amount) and pay using either PayPal or a credit card.They could also add a personal note. If enough people don't chip in, the organizer can ask people to contribute more or choose a less expensive gift. \"I see myself using this most in cases when I typically might not buy someone what they want because of price,\" says Nitzan Shaer of Boston, who was part of an online test of the site. EBay, with its 200 million products, millions of sellers and mobile commerce proficiency, is a logical place to pull together the products, groups of buyers and payment tools, Payne says. At least 12 sites, such as FrumUs.com and eDivvy.com, facilitate (,) group purchases but don't sell products.Although a handful of retailers, including Victoria's Secret and 1-800-Flowers, sell products through Facebook, Payne says he expects social commerce will take off as rapidly as shopping using mobile devices.EBay did more than $600 million in sales on mobile devices last year and expects mobile sales to increase to $1.5 billion this year. Although one in five consumers surveyed said they'd used Facebook for shopping in the past year, 88% said they would not be buying holiday gifts through a social network, mobile phone or smartphone.Of these, 26% were reluctant because of security or privacy concerns, and 20% were unclear about the benefits of using phones or Facebook to shop.

Mrs. Kenny took her to a doctor in Toowoomba, Queensland. In the doctor's, Elizabeth saw many bottles of medicine standing in a row. Since then, she wanted to be a nurse. As soon as she was old enough, Elizabeth was trained in a hospital. After working for some time, she made a surprising discovery. Among her patients were some children who had lost the use of their legs because of polio ( ) . Kenny tried putting hot cloth on their legs and washing them in a special way. The results were great. The children were able to use their legs again. Most doctors would not believe that children could get well in such a simple way. Gradually, however, she became famous. From 1993 on people from many parts of the world brought their children to Australia to receive treatment by this wonderful nurse. She was invited to America where her methods were used in many hospitals. Money was collected to build Kenny foundations which were for polio patients. Kenny died in 1952, but she will long be remembered for her fight against polio. What was Kenny's surprising discovery?\n\nA. there were so many polio patients around her.\nB.

I'd get stamps out of the machine,\" explained Simpson,\" Only I find I have no small change about me.\" \"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I haven't either,\" I said. \"Oh, dear, dear,\" he said. \"Yes, well,\" I said, intending to move off. But he looked so unhappy standing there with the blue unstamped envelope that I really hadn't the heart to desert him. So I took him to my house and found some pennies and gave them to him, who, in the most business like way, made a note of the loan in his pocket-book, and left. But soon he turned up again. \"I'm sorry I am a stranger round here and --well, I'm rather lost...\" It took me several minutes to explain to him where the post office was. In the end I felt as lost as Simpson and had to accompany him to the post office, but, only to find the automatic stamp-machine was empty! \"Oh!\" Simpson was so desperate that he dropped the letter on the ground and when he picked it up there was a large black spot on its face. \"Dear me,\" he said, \"My wife told me to post it tonight. I'd better post it, if you know what I mean.\" I did know. Or, at least, I knew Mrs Simpson. Then I got a good idea, \"Post the letter unstamped--let the other man pay double postage on it in the morning. \" And he had to agree. Finishing off our job, I took him home. \"I'm so grateful to you, really,\" he said when we reached his home. \"That letter--it's only an invitation to dinner to Mr... Dear me!\" \"Why, what's the matter?\" \"Nothing. Just something I've remembered.\" \"What?\" But he didn't tell me. He just opened his eyes and his mouth at me like a wounded gold- fish, murmured a \"Good-night\", and went inside. All the way home I was wondering what it was that he had remembered. But I stopped wondering the next morning, when I had to pay the postman double postage for a blue envelope with a large black spot on its face. How would the writer describe Simpson?\n\nA.

Among professional basketball players, Jeremy Lin's background is not typical. He graduated from Harvard University, which sends few players to the NBA, and he is the only Chinese-American NBA player. But when you watch him on the court, there is no doubt that he belongs there. He moves with speed and grace that demonstrate years of faithful practice, which is fueled by a love for basketball. Lin's enjoyment to basketball actually began in Taiwan. When Lin's father moved to U.S., his interest in the sport only grew and he passed on this love of basketball to his son, introducing him to the game at the age of five. The young Lin spent much of his youth playing basketball for fun. In high school, Lin dreamed of playing in the NBA. When he applied for college, he was not offered a single sports scholarship. However, after his admission to Harvard ,he was offered a place on its college basketball team. During Lin's time at Harvard, his basketball career began to speed up. He scored 1,482 points, making him one of the highest scorers in Ivy League history. When he graduated, no professional teams offered Lin a contract, but he was invited to play in the NBA Summer League. He played well and ended up eagerly signing a contract with the Golden State Warriors. At first, playing in professional games filled Lin with excitement. He treasured opportunities to meet players he had been watching on TV for years. But slowly, the excitement wore off and was replaced by anxiety. In a few very difficult months, he was cut by two teams before the New York Knicks picked him up. But he had the courage and determination to stick to his dream, so he put himself into hard training to get ready for his opportunity to come, Then his moment arrived on February4, 2012,on which his excellent performance made him famous overnight. After that, he led the Knicks to their fifth straight victory. The Associated Press called Lin\"the most surprising story in the NBA.\"Knicks fans developed the nickname for him\"linsanity\" .Time magazine released its 2012 list of the 100\"Most Influential People in the World\",Jermy Lin included. Which of the following is of little help in Lin's success?\n\nA. His devotion to basketball\nB. His father's influence\nC. His years of hard work\nD. His graduation from Harvard University\n\nYour answer: \\box{D}\n"
