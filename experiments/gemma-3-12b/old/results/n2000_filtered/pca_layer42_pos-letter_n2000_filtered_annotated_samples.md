Question: A MENTORING   program is giving life changing opportunities to Banbury youth. Young Inspirations was founded two years ago to provide mentoring sessions for students and unemployed young adults aged 11 to 21. Alex Goldberg, the program's founder, said; "We set up Young Inspirations because we wanted to give young people experiences which will potentially be life changing and broaden their outlook. "We try to create work experience opportunities that will really make a difference to our youth. For example, we've secured internships   with world-famous firms such as Honda. "At a time of funding cutbacks where schools are finding it more and more difficult to offer this kind of mentoring, it is extremely important that these opportunities are available both to help youth with their school work and grades and to give them opportunities which may help shape their futures. " Kieran Hepburn, 14, is one of a group of Banbury youth who has benefited from the program so far. In October the Banbury School pupil was accompanied by Young Inspirations staff to Paris where he was an observer at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) International Youth Forum  . The event was held for young people from around the world, to seek their views on how the future of youth and education should look. Kieran joined several hundred observers mostly in their 20s and was the only UK school pupil to attend the event. Kieran thinks the trip was a life changing experience. " Before we left I didn't quite know what to make of it but when we got there we didn't stop, it was amazing," he said, " We went to three or four hours of debates each day and then did something cultural each afternoon. " The main theme of the forum was how youth can drive change in political and public life. It dealt with issues   such as drug abuse, violence and unemployment. Kieran said: " It has really helped me to improve my confidence and social skills as well as my school grades and I was voted most improved pupil at school in August. " The Young Inspirations mentoring sessions take place each Friday in Banbury. For details visit www.younginspirations.com. According to Alex Goldberg, it is difficult for schools to offer the mentoring due to   _  .

A. the lack of support from firms
B. the cultural differences
C. the effect of unemployment
D. the shortage of money

Your answer:
\box{C}

Question: To be successful in any aspect of life, you need to know when to use the carrot or the stick. Here are a few tips to help you decide whether it's better to use the carrot or the stick. With the kids The carrot When it comes to raising a kid, the carrot or the stick dilemma is quicklydisappearing as too many parents take the carrot approach to the extreme. In child raising, the carrot should never be materialistic things. If you want to ask for good behavior with a reward, it should be with something that can't be bought, say, trust. The stick Nowadays, no one likes to use the stick any more, or in my father's case, the belt. I'm not overlooking child abuse, if you ever want to call it that, but I am encouraging parents to toughen up a bit. You don't want your kid to test your limits only to find out he can get away with it. If you want to raise a kid, raise the hand and let him know it comes down on the second offense. At the office The carrot People need encouragement and motivation to perform well. However, the carrot only really works well with employees who have already proved themselves. Ifyou've got someone who can't show up at the office before noon, the promise of a raise isn't going to do much. On the contrary, if there's a guy with a good work moral, he'll thrive (grow stronger) when you add a promotion to the picture. The stick When considering the carrot or the stick in the office, remember that, overall, the stick is the more practical method in the office. A wise man, who just happened to be an Italian, once said "It's best to be both loved and feared." It's nice to have everyone love you, but running a business isn't like running a family. You need to have the stick constantly raised. With the wife The carrot When it comes to marriage, always use the carrot. I've had a lovely marriage for many years, and I've always stuck to the carrot approach. Sometimes you catch more flies with honey, and sometimes it's the crack of a whip  that gets the horse moving. Try not to use too many sticks at home; the carrot is much more fun. In kids raising, the author prefers   _  .

A. the carrot approach
B. the stick approach
C. both the carrot approach and the stick approach
D. neither the carrot approach nor the stick approach

Your answer: \box{B}

Question: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States. The institute stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. MIT's early emphasis on applied technology at the undergraduate and graduate levels led to close cooperation with industry. Curricular reforms under Karl Compton and Vannevar Bush in the 1930s emphasized basic science. MIT was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934. Today, the institute comprises various academic departments with a strong emphasis on scientific, engineering, and technological education and research. MIT is one of the most selective higher learning institutions, and received 18,357 undergraduate applicants for the class of 2018 -- only admitting 1,419, an acceptance rate of 7.73%. MIT's 168-acre campus spans approximately a mile of the north side of the Charles River basin in the city of Cambridge. The campus is divided roughly in half by Massachusetts Avenue, with most dormitories and student life facilities to the west and most academic buildings to the east. MIT's on-campus nuclear reactor is one of the most powerful university-based nuclear reactors in the United States. In 1999 Bill Gates donated $20 million to MIT for the construction of computer laboratory named the "William H. Gates Building". While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates. Other notable campus facilities include a pressurized wind tunnel and a towing tank for testing ship and ocean structure designs. On MIT's campus, you can't find   _  .

A. Massachusetts Avenue
B. a nuclear reactor
C. a pressurized wind tunnel

Question: Do you like listening to music? Does all of the music bring happiness to you? Do you know some music is noise? What is noise? Noise is a loud or unwanted sound. It is also called noise pollution. Where is noise from? Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects. Scientists use a unit  of measure  called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels. Noise at this high level causes the greatest hearing loss. How do we reduce noise damage? Turn down your music player or wear ear muffs  when you are working in a noisy environment. Ear muffs for human can protect against noise pollution. Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?

A. A decibel is a unit that measures sound.
B. In fact, a decibel is also a kind of noise.
C. A person who hates sound belongs to decibels.
D. Machines that make loud noise are called decibels.

Question: Few of us make money by losing sleep.But three graduate students at Brown University in Providence built a company around sleep deprivation  . Jason Donahue, Ben Rubin and Eric Shashoua were working late nights in Brown's business and engineering schools.They began thinking about ways to sleep better.They discovered they weren't alone in burning the midnight oil.Around 20% of Americans get less than six hours of rest a night. The friends imagined a smart alarm clock that could track how much time people spend in the most restorative   stages of the sleep cycle: REM (rapid eye movement) and deep sleep.What would it cost to design such a thing? Five years of research, 20 employees, $14 million and a whole lot of doubting from investors and scientists. Their company, Zeo, based in Newton, Mass, launched its product in June, 2009.The Zeo device uses a headband with tiny sensors   that scan your brain for signs of four sleep states- REM, light, deep and waking sleep.The smart alarm clock displays a graph of your sleep pattern and wakes you as you're not in REM sleep (which is when you're least groggy).In the morning you can upload the data to the company's Web site, and so track your sleep over time.Most of the feedback comes in the form of Zeo's ZQ score showing how well you've slept. "Zeo allows people to unlock this black box of sleep," says Dave Dickinson, a health-care CEO. Whether any of this actually improves sleep is up to the consumer, who will also need to make lifestyle changes like cutting out alcohol before bedtime or caffeine after 3 pm. For now the company is selling Zeo online only.Dickinson also plans to spread it to countries such as Australia, where sleep deprivation approaches US levels. To design the Zeo device, the three graduate students   _  .

A. spent much time and money
B. were widely supported by scientists
C. worked by themselves all the time
D. attracted many investors

Your answer: \box{A}
