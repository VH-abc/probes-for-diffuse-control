Question: What would be the policy implications of a hierarchical vision of TNC?

A. Hierarchical forms of transnational criminal activity are primarily territorially affiliated to a particular state / ethnic-cultural group and have limited transnational potential.
B. The hierarchical analysts believe that generally there has been a tendency of officials to have over-inflated the estimation of the levels of violence and wealth generated by their activities. If the wealth is not as great as is widely believed, their threat to the licit economy is vastly reduced.
C. Hierarchical forms of organization are highly adaptable and small fluid groups enable a pronounced degree of resilience (attributable to the logic of supply rising to meet demand) against law enforcement efforts confined to rigid ranking of cooperation.
D. Hierarchical groups pose a serious degree of harm by their profit-driven crimes under centralized leadership. Targeting the proceeds or leadership would therefore produce a reduction in their threat on the legitimate economy.

Your answer: \box{A}

Question: On August 10, a retail stationery store sent the following purchase order to a wholesaler of office supply equipment: "Please ship immediately 24 pairs (two dozen) 3 1/2-inch, right-handed scissors at your current list price of $4 per pair. "The wholesaler received this purchase order on August 12. The next day, the wholesaler ascertained that there were only 18 pairs of 3 1/2-inch, right- handed scissors in stock. The wholesaler, however, found that he had six pairs of 3 1/2-inch, lefthanded scissors in stock. Without noti1'ing the stationery store, the wholesaler shipped the 18 pairs of right-handed scissors, along with the six pairs of left-handed scissors, to the stationery store. The stationery store was aware that the wholesale price for the left-handed scissors was $3 per pair, or $1 less than the list price for the right-handed scissors. Was an enforceable contract formed when the wholesaler shipped the 24 pairs of scissors to the stationery store?

A. Yes, because the wholesaler's shipment constituted acceptance of the offer, absent a seasonable notification by the wholesaler to the stationery store that the shipment was made for accommodation only.
B. Yes, because the wholesaler acted in good faith in making the shipment in reliance on the stationery store's offer.
C. No, because the wholesaler could accept the stationery store's offer only by a prompt promise to ship the goods ordered.
D. No, because acceptance by performance of an offer for immediate or prompt shipment is legally binding, unless the nonconforming goods are not reasonably resalable.

Question: The first ionization energy for a neutral atom of chlorine is 1.25 MJ/mol and the first ionization energy for a neutral atom of argon is 1.52 MJ/mol. How would the first ionization energy value for a neutral atom of potassum compare to those values?

A. It would be greater than both because potassium carries a greater nuclear charge then either chlorine or argon.
B. It would be greater than both because the size of a potassium atom is smaller than an atom of either chlorine or argon.
C. It would be less than both because there are more electrons in potassium, meaning they repel each other more effectively and less energy is needed to remove one.
D. It would be less than both because a valence electron of potassium is farther from the nucleus than one of either chlorine or argon.

Question: An investor owned a four-story office building located in downtown. The building was old and badly in need of renovation. To finance the improvements, the investor borrowed $125,000 from his friend. As consideration for the loan, the investor executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the building. The mortgage was dated January 1, and was recorded January 2. Thereafter, on February 1, the investor executed a deed absolute on the building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the investor then delivered the deed to his nephew in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the investor failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1 of the following year, the investor failed to pay the note when it came due. Thereupon, the nephew, in accordance with the escrow instructions, delivered the investor's deed on the office building to the friend, which the friend promptly and properly recorded. Two weeks later, the investor tendered the $125,000 indebtedness to the friend. When the friend refused to accept it, the investor brought an appropriate action to set aside and cancel the deed absolute and to permit the redemption of the building from the friend. Conversely, the friend counterclaimed to quiet title and argued that the deed absolute was intended as an outright conveyance upon default. The court should enter a judgment that will grant the relief sought by

A. the investor, but only if the investor can establish that the mortgage takes precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time.
B. the investor, because the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption.
C. the friend, because the deed absolute effectuated an outright conveyance that extinguished the redemption interest sought to be retained by the investor.
D. the friend, because the investor is estopped to deny the effect of the deed absolute in conjunction with the escrow arrangement.

Your answer:
\box{B}
